8,String to Integer (atoi),"Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:
Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.

Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.

Read in next the characters until the next non-digit charcter or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.

Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `""123"" -> 123`, `""0032"" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).

If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.

Return the integer as the final result.

Note:
Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.

Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""42""
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.

Step 1: ""42"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""42"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""42"" (""42"" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.

Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.


Example 2:
Input: s = ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: ""   -42"" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: ""   -42"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: ""   -42"" (""42"" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.

Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.


Example 3:
Input: s = ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""4193 with words"" (""4193"" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.

Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.


Example 4:
Input: s = ""words and 987""
Output: 0
Explanation:
Step 1: ""words and 987"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""words and 987"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""words and 987"" (reading stops immediately because there is a non-digit 'w')
         ^
The parsed integer is 0 because no digits were read.

Since 0 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 0.


Example 5:
Input: s = ""-91283472332""
Output: -2147483648
Explanation:
Step 1: ""-91283472332"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""-91283472332"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
          ^
Step 3: ""-91283472332"" (""91283472332"" is read in)
                     ^
The parsed integer is -91283472332.

Since -91283472332 is less than the lower bound of the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is clamped to -231 = -2147483648.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
`I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.

71,Simplify Path,"Given a string `path`, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:
The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.

Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.

The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.

The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.

Internally you can think of this:
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.

// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.

'A' -> ""1""
'B' -> ""2""
...

'Z' -> ""26""
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `""11106""` can be mapped into:
`""AAJF""` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
`""KJF""` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`
Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `""06""` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `""6""` is different from `""06""`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.


Example 1:

Explanation: ""226"" could be decoded as ""BZ"" (2 26), ""VF"" (22 6), or ""BBF"" (2 2 6).


Example 3:
Input: s = ""0""
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with 0.

The only valid mappings with 0 are 'J' -> ""10"" and 'T' -> ""20"", neither of which start with 0.

Hence, there are no valid ways to decode this since all digits need to be mapped.

Input: s = ""06""
Output: 0
Explanation: ""06"" cannot be mapped to ""F"" because of the leading zero (""6"" is different from ""06"").

133,Clone Graph,"Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
Test case format:
For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val = 1`, the second node with `val = 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

Adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.


Example 1:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.

1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).

2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).

4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).


Example 2:
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

134,Gas Station,"There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

Example 1:
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.

Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.


Example 2:
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.

Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.

Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

138,Copy List with Random Pointer,"A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:
`val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
`random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).

From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.


Example 2:

Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).

From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.


Example 3:
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.

Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.


Constraints:
The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.

The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.

`0 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`

174,Dungeon Game,"The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.

Note that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.


Example 1:
Input: dungeon = [[-2,-3,3],[-5,-10,1],[10,30,-5]]

Some courses may have `prerequisites`, for example, if `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` this means you must take the course `bi` before the course `ai`.

Given the total number of courses `numCourses` and a list of the `prerequisite` pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.


Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

218,The Skyline Problem,"A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:
`lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.

`righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.

`heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The skyline should be represented as a list of ""key points"" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

232,Implement Queue using Stacks,"Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:
`void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.

`int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.

`int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.

`boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.

Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.


Example 1:
Input
[""MyQueue"", ""push"", ""push"", ""peek"", ""pop"", ""empty""]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]
Explanation
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

288,Unique Word Abbreviation,"The abbreviation of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word has only two characters, then it is an abbreviation of itself.

For example:
`dog --> d1g` because there is one letter between the first letter `'d'` and the last letter `'g'`.

`internationalization --> i18n` because there are 18 letters between the first letter `'i'` and the last letter `'n'`.

`it --> it` because any word with only two characters is an abbreviation of itself.

Implement the `ValidWordAbbr` class:

A string `s` matches a `pattern` if there is some bijective mapping of single characters to strings such that if each character in `pattern` is replaced by the string it maps to, then the resulting string is `s`. A bijective mapping means that no two characters map to the same string, and no character maps to two different strings.


Example 1:
Input: pattern = ""abab"", s = ""redblueredblue""
Output: true
Explanation: One possible mapping is as follows:

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return an array of integers `answer` where `answer[i]` is the number of islands after turning the cell `(ri, ci)` into a land.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

351,Android Unlock Patterns,"Android devices have a special lock screen with a `3 x 3` grid of dots. Users can set an ""unlock pattern"" by connecting the dots in a specific sequence, forming a series of joined line segments where each segment's endpoints are two consecutive dots in the sequence. A sequence of `k` dots is a valid unlock pattern if both of the following are true:
All the dots in the sequence are distinct.

If the line segment connecting two consecutive dots in the sequence passes through any other dot, the other dot must have previously appeared in the sequence. No jumps through non-selected dots are allowed.

Here are some example valid and invalid unlock patterns:
The 1st pattern `[4,1,3,6]` is invalid because the line connecting dots `1` and `3` pass through dot `2`, but dot `2` did not previously appear in the sequence.

The 2nd pattern `[4,1,9,2]` is invalid because the line connecting dots `1` and `9` pass through dot `5`, but dot `5` did not previously appear in the sequence.

The 3rd pattern `[2,4,1,3,6]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `3` meets the condition because dot `2` previously appeared in the sequence.

The 4th pattern `[6,5,4,1,9,2]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `9` meets the condition because dot `5` previously appeared in the sequence.

Given two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of unique and valid unlock patterns of the Android grid lock screen that consist of at least `m` keys and at most `n` keys.

Two unlock patterns are considered unique if there is a dot in one sequence that is not in the other, or the order of the dots is different.

The snake is initially positioned at the top left corner `(0, 0)` with a length of `1` unit.

You are given an array `food` where `food[i] = (ri, ci)` is the row and column position of a piece of food that the snake can eat. When a snake eats a piece of food, its length and the game's score both increase by `1`.

Each piece of food appears one by one on the screen, meaning the second piece of food will not appear until the snake eats the first piece of food.

When a piece of food appears on the screen, it is guaranteed that it will not appear on a block occupied by the snake.

The game is over if the snake goes out of bounds (hits a wall) or if its head occupies a space that its body occupies after moving (i.e. a snake of length 4 cannot run into itself).

If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.

        - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.

        - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.

    - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.

        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.

        - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.

            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.

            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.

            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.

        - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.

            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.

            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.

The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.

`int getRandom()` Returns a random element from the current multiset of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of same values the multiset contains.


Example 1:
Input
[""RandomizedCollection"", ""insert"", ""insert"", ""insert"", ""getRandom"", ""remove"", ""getRandom""]
[[], [1], [1], [2], [], [1], []]
Output
[null, true, false, true, 2, true, 1]
Explanation
RandomizedCollection randomizedCollection = new RandomizedCollection();
randomizedCollection.insert(1);   // return True. Inserts 1 to the collection. Returns true as the collection did not contain 1.

randomizedCollection.insert(1);   // return False. Inserts another 1 to the collection. Returns false as the collection contained 1. Collection now contains [1,1].

randomizedCollection.insert(2);   // return True. Inserts 2 to the collection, returns true. Collection now contains [1,1,2].

randomizedCollection.getRandom(); // getRandom should return 1 with the probability 2/3, and returns 2 with the probability 1/3.

randomizedCollection.remove(1);   // return True. Removes 1 from the collection, returns true. Collection now contains [1,2].

randomizedCollection.getRandom(); // getRandom should return 1 and 2 both equally likely.

A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:
For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a `0`, followed by its Unicode code.

For an n-bytes character, the first `n` bits are all one's, the `n + 1` bit is `0`, followed by `n - 1` bytes with the most significant `2` bits being `10`.

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:
`   Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
      (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)

   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`
Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.


Example 1:
Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.

It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.


Example 2:
Input: data = [235,140,4]
Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.

The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.

The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.

Explanation:
F(0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25
F(1) = (0 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
F(2) = (0 * 2) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
F(3) = (0 * 3) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26

There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.

The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],

411,Minimum Unique Word Abbreviation,"A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent substrings with their lengths. For example, a string such as `""substitution""` could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):
`""s10n""` (`""s ubstitutio n""`)
`""sub4u4""` (`""sub stit u tion""`)
`""12""` (`""substitution""`)
`""su3i1u2on""` (`""su bst i t u ti on""`)
`""substitution""` (no substrings replaced)
Note that `""s55n""` (`""s ubsti tutio n""`) is not a valid abbreviation of `""substitution""` because the replaced substrings are adjacent.

The length of an abbreviation is the number of letters that were not replaced plus the number of substrings that were replaced. For example, the abbreviation `""s10n""` has a length of `3` (`2` letters + `1` substring) and `""su3i1u2on""` has a length of `9` (`6` letters + `3` substrings).

Given a target string `target` and an array of strings `dictionary`, return an abbreviation of `target` with the shortest possible length such that it is not an abbreviation of any string in `dictionary`. If there are multiple shortest abbreviations, return any of them.


Example 1:
Input: target = ""apple"", dictionary = [""blade""]
Output: ""a4""
Explanation: The shortest abbreviation of ""apple"" is ""5"", but this is also an abbreviation of ""blade"".

The next shortest abbreviations are ""a4"" and ""4e"". ""4e"" is an abbreviation of blade while ""a4"" is not.

Hence, return ""a4"".


Example 2:
Input: target = ""apple"", dictionary = [""blade"",""plain"",""amber""]
Output: ""1p3""
Explanation: ""5"" is an abbreviation of both ""apple"" but also every word in the dictionary.

""a4"" is an abbreviation of ""apple"" but also ""amber"".

""4e"" is an abbreviation of ""apple"" but also ""blade"".

""1p3"", ""2p2"", and ""3l1"" are the next shortest abbreviations of ""apple"".

Since none of them are abbreviations of words in the dictionary, returning any of them is correct.

You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the predecessor and successor pointers in a doubly-linked list. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.

We want to do the transformation in place. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. You should return the pointer to the smallest element of the linked list.


Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3]

428,Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree,"Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following `3-ary` tree
as `[1 [3[5 6] 2 4]]`. Note that this is just an example, you do not necessarily need to follow this format.

Or you can follow LeetCode's level order traversal serialization format, where each group of children is separated by the null value.

For example, the above tree may be serialized as `[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]`.

You do not necessarily need to follow the above suggested formats, there are many more different formats that work so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |

The serialization of each level is as follows:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
[null,11,12,null]
Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.

The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.

If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.

The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.

Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.

The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. There is also a hole in this maze. The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls onto the hole.

Given the `m x n` `maze`, the ball's position `ball` and the hole's position `hole`, where `ball = [ballrow, ballcol]` and `hole = [holerow, holecol]`, return a string `instructions` of all the instructions that the ball should follow to drop in the hole with the shortest distance possible.

Explanation: There are two shortest ways for the ball to drop into the hole.

The first way is left -> up -> left, represented by ""lul"".

The second way is up -> left, represented by 'ul'.

Both ways have shortest distance 6, but the first way is lexicographically smaller because 'l' < 'u'. So the output is ""lul"".

Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects. 
You are given several projects. For each project i, it has a pure profit Pi and a minimum capital of Ci is needed to start the corresponding project. Initially, you have W capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

To sum up, pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and output your final maximized capital.


Example 1:
Input: k=2, W=0, Profits=[1,2,3], Capital=[0,1,1].
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.

             After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.

             With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.

             Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:
You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place, which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character key[i].

If the character key[i] has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.

528,Random Pick with Weight,"You are given an array of positive integers `w` where `w[i]` describes the weight of `i``th` index (0-indexed).

We need to call the function `pickIndex()` which randomly returns an integer in the range `[0, w.length - 1]`. `pickIndex()` should return the integer proportional to its weight in the `w` array. For example, for `w = [1, 3]`, the probability of picking the index `0` is `1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25` (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the index `1` is `3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75` (i.e 75%).

More formally, the probability of picking index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.


Example 1:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]
Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. Since there is only one single element on the array the only option is to return the first element.


Example 2:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It's returning the second element (index = 1) that has probability of 3/4.

solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It's returning the first element (index = 0) that has probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed so the following outputs can be considered correct :
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]

Now given the next click position (row and column indices) among all the unrevealed squares ('M' or 'E'), return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:
If a mine ('M') is revealed, then the game is over - change it to 'X'.

If an empty square ('E') with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to revealed blank ('B') and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.

If an empty square ('E') with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.

544,Output Contest Matches,"During the NBA playoffs, we always arrange the rather strong team to play with the rather weak team, like make the rank 1 team play with the rank nth team, which is a good strategy to make the contest more interesting. Now, you're given n teams, you need to output their final contest matches in the form of a string.

The n teams are given in the form of positive integers from 1 to n, which represents their initial rank. (Rank 1 is the strongest team and Rank n is the weakest team.) We'll use parentheses('(', ')') and commas(',') to represent the contest team pairing - parentheses('(' , ')') for pairing and commas(',') for partition. During the pairing process in each round, you always need to follow the strategy of making the rather strong one pair with the rather weak one.


Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: (1,2)
Explanation: 
Initially, we have the team 1 and the team 2, placed like: 1,2.

Then we pair the team (1,2) together with '(', ')' and ',', which is the final answer.


Example 2:
Input: 4
Output: ((1,4),(2,3))
Explanation: 
In the first round, we pair the team 1 and 4, the team 2 and 3 together, as we need to make the strong team and weak team together.

And we got (1,4),(2,3).

In the second round, the winners of (1,4) and (2,3) need to play again to generate the final winner, so you need to add the paratheses outside them.

And we got the final answer ((1,4),(2,3)).


Example 3:
Input: 8
Output: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))
Explanation: 
First round: (1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5)
Second round: ((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))
Third round: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))
Since the third round will generate the final winner, you need to output the answer (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))).

545,Boundary of Binary Tree,"The boundary of a binary tree is the concatenation of the root, the left boundary, the leaves ordered from left-to-right, and the reverse order of the right boundary.

The left boundary is the set of nodes defined by the following:
The root node's left child is in the left boundary. If the root does not have a left child, then the left boundary is empty.

If a node in the left boundary and has a left child, then the left child is in the left boundary.

If a node is in the left boundary, has no left child, but has a right child, then the right child is in the left boundary.

The leftmost leaf is not in the left boundary.

The right boundary is similar to the left boundary, except it is the right side of the root's right subtree. Again, the leaf is not part of the right boundary, and the right boundary is empty if the root does not have a right child.

The leaves are nodes that do not have any children. For this problem, the root is not a leaf.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the values of its boundary.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,4,2]
Explanation:
- The left boundary is empty because the root does not have a left child.

- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root's right child 2 -> 4.

  4 is a leaf, so the right boundary is [2].

- The leaves from left to right are [3,4].

Concatenating everything results in [1] + [] + [3,4] + [2] = [1,3,4,2].


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10]
Output: [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]
Explanation:
- The left boundary follows the path starting from the root's left child 2 -> 4.

  4 is a leaf, so the left boundary is [2].

- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root's right child 3 -> 6 -> 10.

  10 is a leaf, so the right boundary is [3,6], and in reverse order is [6,3].

- The leaves from left to right are [4,7,8,9,10].

Concatenating everything results in [1] + [2] + [4,7,8,9,10] + [6,3] = [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].

568,Maximum Vacation Days,"LeetCode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among N cities to collect algorithm problems. But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.

Rules and restrictions:
You can only travel among N cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.

The cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a N*N matrix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i.

You totally have K weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time.

For each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an N*K matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j.

You're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the maximum vacation days you could take during K weeks.


Example 1:
Input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]
Output: 12
Explanation: Ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. 
One of the best strategies is:
1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day. (Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is Monday.) 
2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days.

3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.


Example 2:
Input:flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Ans = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. 
Since there is no flights enable you to move to another city, you have to stay at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks. For each week, you only have one day to play and six days to work. So the maximum number of vacation days is 3.


Example 3:
Input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]]
Output: 21
Explanation:Ans = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21
One of the best strategies is:
1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days. 
2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 7 days.

3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 7 days.

Note:
N and K are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100].

In the matrix flights, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1].

In the matrix days, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7].

You could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days.

If you fly from the city A to the city B and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city B in that week.

591,Tag Validator,"Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:
The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.

A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`. Among them, `<TAG_NAME>` is the start tag, and `</TAG_NAME>` is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.

A valid `TAG_NAME` only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the `TAG_NAME` is invalid.

A valid `TAG_CONTENT` may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the `TAG_CONTENT` is invalid.

A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.

A `<` is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent `>`. And when you find a `<` or `</`, all the subsequent characters until the next `>` should be parsed as TAG_NAME  (not necessarily valid).

The cdata has the following format : `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`. The range of `CDATA_CONTENT` is defined as the characters between `<![CDATA[` and the first subsequent `]]>`. 
`CDATA_CONTENT` may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse `CDATA_CONTENT`, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. 

Valid Code Examples:
Input: ""<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>""
Output: True
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.

So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.

Input: ""<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>""
Output: True
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.

start_tag -> ""<DIV>""
end_tag -> ""</DIV>""
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.

text1 -> "">>  ![cdata[]] ""
cdata -> ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>"", where the CDATA_CONTENT is ""<div>]>""
text2 -> ""]]>>]""
The reason why start_tag is NOT ""<DIV>>>"" is because of the rule 6.

The reason why cdata is NOT ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>"" is because of the rule 7.


Invalid Code Examples:
Input: ""<A>  <B> </A>   </B>""
Output: False
Explanation: Unbalanced. If ""<A>"" is closed, then ""<B>"" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

Input: ""<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>""
Output: False
Input: ""<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>""
Output: False
Input: ""<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>""
Output: False
Input: ""<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>""

623,Add One Row to Tree,"Given the `root` of a binary tree and two integers `val` and `depth`, add a row of nodes with value `val` at the given depth `depth`.

Note that the `root` node is at depth `1`.

The adding rule is:
Given the integer `depth`, for each not null tree node `cur` at the depth `depth - 1`, create two tree nodes with value `val` as `cur`'s left subtree root and right subtree root.

`cur`'s original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root.

`cur`'s original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root.

If `depth == 1` that means there is no depth `depth - 1` at all, then create a tree node with value `val` as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.

636,Exclusive Time of Functions,"On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing `n` functions. Each function has a unique ID between `0` and `n-1`.

Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.

You are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `ith` log message formatted as a string `""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}""`. For example, `""0:start:3""` means a function call with function ID `0` started at the beginning of timestamp `3`, and `""1:end:2""` means a function call with function ID `1` ended at the end of timestamp `2`. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.

A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for `2` time units and another call executing for `1` time unit, the exclusive time is `2 + 1 = 3`.

Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the `ith` index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID `i`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""1:start:2"",""1:end:5"",""0:end:6""]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.

Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.

Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.

So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.


Example 2:
Input: n = 1, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""0:start:6"",""0:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.

Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.

Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.

Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.

Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.

So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.


Example 3:
Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:6"",""1:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [7,1]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.

Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.

Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.

Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 units of time, and ends at the end of time 6.

Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.

So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.


Example 4:
Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:7"",""1:end:7"",""0:end:8""]

639,Decode Ways II,"A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> ""1""
'B' -> ""2""
...

'Z' -> ""26""
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `""11106""` can be mapped into:
`""AAJF""` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
`""KJF""` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`
Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `""06""` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `""6""` is different from `""06""`.

In addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the `'*'` character, which can represent any digit from `'1'` to `'9'` (`'0'` is excluded). For example, the encoded message `""1*""` may represent any of the encoded messages `""11""`, `""12""`, `""13""`, `""14""`, `""15""`, `""16""`, `""17""`, `""18""`, or `""19""`. Decoding `""1*""` is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.

Given a string `s` containing digits and the `'*'` character, return the number of ways to decode it.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""*""
Output: 9
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", or ""9"".

Each of these can be decoded to the strings ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"", ""F"", ""G"", ""H"", and ""I"" respectively.

Hence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode ""*"".


Example 2:
Input: s = ""1*""
Output: 18
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"".

Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. ""11"" can be decoded to ""AA"" or ""K"").

Hence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode ""1*"".


Example 3:
Input: s = ""2*""
Output: 15
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", ""26"", ""27"", ""28"", or ""29"".

""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", and ""26"" have 2 ways of being decoded, but ""27"", ""28"", and ""29"" only have 1 way.

When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.

Your job is to implement the following functions:
The constructor function:
`AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times):` This is the constructor. The input is historical data. `Sentences` is a string array consists of previously typed sentences. `Times` is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.

Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next character the user types:
`List<String> input(char c):` The input `c` is the next character typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters (`'a'` to `'z'`), blank space (`' '`) or a special character (`'#'`). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output will be the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.


Example:
Operation: AutocompleteSystem([""i love you"", ""island"",""ironman"", ""i love leetcode""], [5,3,2,2])
The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding times:
`""i love you""` : `5` times
`""island""` : `3` times
`""ironman""` : `2` times
`""i love leetcode""` : `2` times
Now, the user begins another search:
Operation: input('i')
Output: [""i love you"", ""island"",""i love leetcode""]
Explanation:
There are four sentences that have prefix `""i""`. Among them, ""ironman"" and ""i love leetcode"" have same hot degree. Since `' '` has ASCII code 32 and `'r'` has ASCII code 114, ""i love leetcode"" should be in front of ""ironman"". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so ""ironman"" will be ignored.

Operation: input(' ')
Output: [""i love you"",""i love leetcode""]
Explanation:
There are only two sentences that have prefix `""i ""`.

Operation: input('a')
Output: []
Explanation:
There are no sentences that have prefix `""i a""`.

Operation: input('#')
Output: []
Explanation:
The user finished the input, the sentence `""i a""` should be saved as a historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search.

Note:
The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and only one blank space will exist between two words.

The number of complete sentences that to be searched won't exceed 100. The length of each sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed 100.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is greater than or equal to `k` that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than `10-5` will be accepted.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75000
Explanation:
- When the length is 4, averages are [0.5, 12.75, 10.5] and the maximum average is 12.75
- When the length is 5, averages are [10.4, 10.8] and the maximum average is 10.8
- When the length is 6, averages are [9.16667] and the maximum average is 9.16667
The maximum average is when we choose a subarray of length 4 (i.e., the sub array [12, -5, -6, 50]) which has the max average 12.75, so we return 12.75

649,Dota2 Senate,"In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the `Radiant` and the `Dire`.

The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the senate wants to make a decision about a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise `one` of the two rights:
`Ban one senator's right`:
	A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.

`Announce the victory`:
	If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and make the decision about the change in the game.

Given a string representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the `Radiant` party and the `Dire` party respectively. Then if there are `n` senators, the size of the given string will be `n`.

The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.

Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party, you need to predict which party will finally announce the victory and make the change in the Dota2 game. The output should be `Radiant` or `Dire`.

The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with `n` nodes (with distinct values from `1` to `n`), with one additional directed edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of `edges`. Each element of `edges` is a pair `[ui, vi]` that represents a directed edge connecting nodes `ui` and `vi`, where `ui` is a parent of child `vi`.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of `n` nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.

688,Knight Probability in Chessboard,"On an `N`x`N` chessboard, a knight starts at the `r`-th row and `c`-th column and attempts to make exactly `K` moves. The rows and columns are 0 indexed, so the top-left square is `(0, 0)`, and the bottom-right square is `(N-1, N-1)`.

A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.

The knight continues moving until it has made exactly `K` moves or has moved off the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.

The square is dropped with the bottom edge parallel to the number line, and from a higher height than all currently landed squares. We wait for each square to stick before dropping the next.

The squares are infinitely sticky on their bottom edge, and will remain fixed to any positive length surface they touch (either the number line or another square). Squares dropped adjacent to each other will not stick together prematurely.

Return a list `ans` of heights. Each height `ans[i]` represents the current highest height of any square we have dropped, after dropping squares represented by `positions[0], positions[1], ..., positions[i]`.

`void remove(key)` removes the `key` and its corresponding `value` if the map contains the mapping for the `key`.


Example 1:

707,Design Linked List,"Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.

A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: `val` and `next`. `val` is the value of the current node, and `next` is a pointer/reference to the next node.

If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute `prev` to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

Implement the `MyLinkedList` class:
`MyLinkedList()` Initializes the `MyLinkedList` object.

`int get(int index)` Get the value of the `indexth` node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return `-1`.

`void addAtHead(int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.

`void addAtTail(int val)` Append a node of value `val` as the last element of the linked list.

`void addAtIndex(int index, int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the `indexth` node in the linked list. If `index` equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If `index` is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.

`void deleteAtIndex(int index)` Delete the `indexth` node in the linked list, if the index is valid.


Example 1:
Input
[""MyLinkedList"", ""addAtHead"", ""addAtTail"", ""addAtIndex"", ""get"", ""deleteAtIndex"", ""get""]
[[], [1], [3], [1, 2], [1], [1], [1]]
Output

708,Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List,"Given a node from a Circular Linked List which is sorted in ascending order, write a function to insert a value `insertVal` into the list such that it remains a sorted circular list. The given node can be a reference to any single node in the list, and may not be necessarily the smallest value in the circular list.

If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value. After the insertion, the circular list should remain sorted.

If the list is empty (i.e., given node is `null`), you should create a new single circular list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the original given node.


Example 1:
Input: head = [3,4,1], insertVal = 2
Output: [3,4,1,2]
Explanation: In the figure above, there is a sorted circular list of three elements. You are given a reference to the node with value 3, and we need to insert 2 into the list. The new node should be inserted between node 1 and node 3. After the insertion, the list should look like this, and we should still return node 3.


Example 2:
Input: head = [], insertVal = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The list is empty (given head is `null`). We create a new single circular list and return the reference to that single node.

Count the number of distinct islands.  An island is considered to be the same as another if they have the same shape, or have the same shape after rotation (90, 180, or 270 degrees only) or reflection (left/right direction or up/down direction).

712,Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings,"Given two strings `s1, s2`, find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.


Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""sea"", s2 = ""eat""
Output: 231
Explanation: Deleting ""s"" from ""sea"" adds the ASCII value of ""s"" (115) to the sum.

Deleting ""t"" from ""eat"" adds 116 to the sum.

At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.


Example 2:
Input: s1 = ""delete"", s2 = ""leet""
Output: 403
Explanation: Deleting ""dee"" from ""delete"" to turn the string into ""let"",
adds 100[d]+101[e]+101[e] to the sum.  Deleting ""e"" from ""leet"" adds 101[e] to the sum.

At the end, both strings are equal to ""let"", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.

If instead we turned both strings into ""lee"" or ""eet"", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.

Given a 2D integer array `board` representing the grid of candy, different positive integers `board[i][j]` represent different types of candies. A value of `board[i][j] = 0` represents that the cell at position `(i, j)` is empty. The given board represents the state of the game following the player's move. Now, you need to restore the board to a stable state by crushing candies according to the following rules:
If three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or horizontally, ""crush"" them all at the same time - these positions become empty.

After crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the board has candies on top of itself, then these candies will drop until they hit a candy or bottom at the same time. (No new candies will drop outside the top boundary.)
After the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed. If so, you need to repeat the above steps.

If there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (ie. the board is stable), then return the current board.

726,Number of Atoms,"Given a chemical `formula` (given as a string), return the count of each atom.

The atomic element always starts with an uppercase character, then zero or more lowercase letters, representing the name.

One or more digits representing that element's count may follow if the count is greater than 1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow. For example, H2O and H2O2 are possible, but H1O2 is impossible.

Two formulas concatenated together to produce another formula. For example, H2O2He3Mg4 is also a formula.

A formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a formula. For example, (H2O2) and (H2O2)3 are formulas.

Given a `formula`, return the count of all elements as a string in the following form: the first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), followed by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), and so on.


Example 1:
Input: formula = ""H2O""
Output: ""H2O""
Explanation: The count of elements are {'H': 2, 'O': 1}.


Example 2:
Input: formula = ""Mg(OH)2""

A subsequence of a string S is obtained by deleting 0 or more characters from S.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `A_1, A_2, ...` and `B_1, B_2, ...` are different if there is some `i` for which `A_i != B_i`.

731,My Calendar II,"Implement a `MyCalendarTwo` class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.

Your class will have one method, `book(int start, int end)`. Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval `[start, end)`, the range of real numbers `x` such that `start <= x < end`.

A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to all 3 events.)
For each call to the method `MyCalendar.book`, return `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.

Your class will be called like this: `MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar();` `MyCalendar.book(start, end)`

Explanation: 
The first two events can be booked.  The third event can be double booked.

The fourth event (5, 15) can't be booked, because it would result in a triple booking.

The fifth event (5, 10) can be booked, as it does not use time 10 which is already double booked.

the time [40, 50) will be single booked, and the time [50, 55) will be double booked with the second event.

Note:

Two sentences are similar if:
They have the same length (i.e. the same number of words)
`sentence1[i]` and `sentence2[i]` are similar.

Notice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if the words `a` and `b` are similar and the words `b` and `c` are similar, `a` and `c` are not necessarily similar.

Explanation: A word is similar to itself.


Example 3:

Note that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if ""great"" and ""good"" are similar, and ""fine"" and ""good"" are similar, then ""great"" and ""fine"" are similar.

Similarity is also symmetric. For example, ""great"" and ""fine"" being similar is the same as ""fine"" and ""great"" being similar.

Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences `words1 = [""great""], words2 = [""great""], pairs = []` are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.

A completing word is a word that contains all the letters in `licensePlate`. Ignore numbers and spaces in `licensePlate`, and treat letters as case insensitive. If a letter appears more than once in `licensePlate`, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.

For example, if `licensePlate`` = ""aBc 12c""`, then it contains letters `'a'`, `'b'` (ignoring case), and `'c'` twice. Possible completing words are `""abccdef""`, `""caaacab""`, and `""cbca""`.

Return the shortest completing word in `words`. It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that occurs in `words`.


Example 1:
Input: licensePlate = ""1s3 PSt"", words = [""step"",""steps"",""stripe"",""stepple""]
Output: ""steps""
Explanation: licensePlate contains letters 's', 'p', 's' (ignoring case), and 't'.

""step"" contains 't' and 'p', but only contains 1 's'.

""steps"" contains 't', 'p', and both 's' characters.

""stripe"" is missing an 's'.

""stepple"" is missing an 's'.

Since ""steps"" is the only word containing all the letters, that is the answer.


Example 2:
Input: licensePlate = ""1s3 456"", words = [""looks"",""pest"",""stew"",""show""]
Output: ""pest""
Explanation: licensePlate only contains the letter 's'. All the words contain 's', but among these ""pest"", ""stew"", and ""show"" are shortest. The answer is ""pest"" because it is the word that appears earliest of the 3.

749,Contain Virus,"A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.

The world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where `0` represents uninfected cells, and `1` represents cells contaminated with the virus.  A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.

Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall.

Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region -- the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night. There will never be a tie.

Can you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not, and the world becomes fully infected, return the number of walls used.


Example 1:
Input: grid = 
[[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],

Example 2:
Input: grid =

751,IP to CIDR,"Given a start IP address `ip` and a number of ips we need to cover `n`, return a representation of the range as a list (of smallest possible length) of CIDR blocks.

A CIDR block is a string consisting of an IP, followed by a slash, and then the prefix length.  For example: ""123.45.67.89/20"".  That prefix length ""20"" represents the number of common prefix bits in the specified range.


Example 1:
Input: ip = ""255.0.0.7"", n = 10
Output: [""255.0.0.7/32"",""255.0.0.8/29"",""255.0.0.16/32""]
Explanation:
The initial ip address, when converted to binary, looks like this (spaces added for clarity):
255.0.0.7 -> 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000111
The address ""255.0.0.7/32"" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,
ie. just this one address.

The address ""255.0.0.8/29"" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 29 bits to the given address:
255.0.0.8 -> 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001000
Addresses with common prefix of 29 bits are:
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001000
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001001
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001010
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001011
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001100
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001101
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001110
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001111
The address ""255.0.0.16/32"" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,
ie. just 11111111 00000000 00000000 00010000.

In total, the answer specifies the range of 10 ips starting with the address 255.0.0.7 .

There were other representations, such as:
[""255.0.0.7/32"",""255.0.0.8/30"", ""255.0.0.12/30"", ""255.0.0.16/32""],
but our answer was the shortest possible.

Also note that a representation beginning with say, ""255.0.0.7/30"" would be incorrect,
because it includes addresses like 255.0.0.4 = 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000100 
that are outside the specified range.

752,Open the Lock,"You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: `'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'`. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn `'9'` to be `'0'`, or `'0'` to be `'9'`. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at `'0000'`, a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a list of `deadends` dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a `target` representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

Explanation:
A sequence of valid moves would be ""0000"" -> ""1000"" -> ""1100"" -> ""1200"" -> ""1201"" -> ""1202"" -> ""0202"".

Note that a sequence like ""0000"" -> ""0001"" -> ""0002"" -> ""0102"" -> ""0202"" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end ""0102"".

Explanation:
We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from ""0000"" -> ""0009"".

Explanation:
6 -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7 -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)

An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.

A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.

A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like `""2x""` or `""-x""`.

Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction. For example, `expression = ""1 + 2 * 3""` has an answer of `[""7""]`.

The format of the output is as follows:
For each term of free variables with non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a term like `""b*a*c""`, only `""a*b*c""`.

Terms have degree equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. (For example, `""a*a*b*c""` has degree 4.) We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.

The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.)  A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.

An example of a well formatted answer is `[""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""]` 
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.  For example, an expression of ""0"" has an output of [].


Examples:
Input: expression = ""e + 8 - a + 5"", evalvars = [""e""], evalints = [1]

You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:
There are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).

There are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).

If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).

The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.

A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets `A` and `B` such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set `A` and a node in set `B`.

Return `true` if and only if it is bipartite.

All inputs are integral coordinates.

Each turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either move 1 unit in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west or stay still. All actions happen simultaneously.

You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) at the same time as a ghost, it does not count as an escape.

When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)
For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.

It is directly connected to the top of the grid, or
At least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is stable.

You are also given an array `hits`, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location `hits[i] = (rowi, coli)`. The brick on that location (if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the `grid` (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).

Return an array `result`, where each `result[i]` is the number of bricks that will fall after the `ith` erasure is applied.

Note that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,0]], hits = [[1,0]]
Output: [2]
Explanation: Starting with the grid:

 [1,1,1,0]]
We erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0]]
The two underlined bricks are no longer stable as they are no longer connected to the top nor adjacent to another stable brick, so they will fall. The resulting grid is:

Hence the result is [2].


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0]], hits = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [0,0]
Explanation: Starting with the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]
We erase the underlined brick at (1,1), resulting in the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]]
All remaining bricks are still stable, so no bricks fall. The grid remains the same:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]]
Next, we erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:

Serve 100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B
Serve 75 ml of soup A and 25 ml of soup B
Serve 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B
Serve 25 ml of soup A and 75 ml of soup B
When we serve some soup, we give it to someone and we no longer have it.  Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as we can.  We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.

Note that we do not have the operation where all 100 ml's of soup B are used first.  
Return the probability that soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time.


Example:
Input: N = 50
Output: 0.625
Explanation: 
If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first. For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time. For the fourth operation, B will become empty first. So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.

810,Chalkboard XOR Game,"We are given non-negative integers nums[i] which are written on a chalkboard.  Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first.  If erasing a number causes the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become 0, then that player loses.  (Also, we'll say the bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is 0.)
Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to 0, then that player wins.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.


Example:
Input: nums = [1, 1, 2]
Output: false
Explanation: 
Alice has two choices: erase 1 or erase 2. 
If she erases 1, the nums array becomes [1, 2]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 2 = 3. Now Bob can remove any element he wants, because Alice will be the one to erase the last element and she will lose. 
If Alice erases 2 first, now nums becomes [1, 1]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 1 = 0. Alice will lose.

811,Subdomain Visit Count,"A website domain like ""discuss.leetcode.com"" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have ""com"", at the next level, we have ""leetcode.com"", and at the lowest level, ""discuss.leetcode.com"". When we visit a domain like ""discuss.leetcode.com"", we will also visit the parent domains ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" implicitly.

Now, call a ""count-paired domain"" to be a count (representing the number of visits this domain received), followed by a space, followed by the address. An example of a count-paired domain might be ""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"".

We are given a list `cpdomains` of count-paired domains. We would like a list of count-paired domains, (in the same format as the input, and in any order), that explicitly counts the number of visits to each subdomain.


Example 1:
Input: 
[""9001 discuss.leetcode.com""]
Output: 
[""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"", ""9001 leetcode.com"", ""9001 com""]
Explanation: 
We only have one website domain: ""discuss.leetcode.com"". As discussed above, the subdomain ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" will also be visited. So they will all be visited 9001 times.


Example 2:
Input: 
[""900 google.mail.com"", ""50 yahoo.com"", ""1 intel.mail.com"", ""5 wiki.org""]
Output: 
[""901 mail.com"",""50 yahoo.com"",""900 google.mail.com"",""5 wiki.org"",""5 org"",""1 intel.mail.com"",""951 com""]
Explanation: 
We will visit ""google.mail.com"" 900 times, ""yahoo.com"" 50 times, ""intel.mail.com"" once and ""wiki.org"" 5 times. For the subdomains, we will visit ""mail.com"" 900 + 1 = 901 times, ""com"" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and ""org"" 5 times.

Example:
Input: 
A = [9,1,2,3,9]

842,Split Array into Fibonacci Sequence,"Given a string `S` of digits, such as `S = ""123456579""`, we can split it into a Fibonacci-like sequence `[123, 456, 579].`
Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list `F` of non-negative integers such that:
`0 <= F[i] <= 2^31 - 1`, (that is, each integer fits a 32-bit signed integer type);
`F.length >= 3`;
and` F[i] + F[i+1] = F[i+2] `for all `0 <= i < F.length - 2`.

Also, note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.

Return any Fibonacci-like sequence split from `S`, or return `[]` if it cannot be done.

We'll say that `richer[i] = [x, y]` if person `x` definitely has more money than person `y`.  Note that `richer` may only be a subset of valid observations.

Also, we'll say `quiet[x] = q` if person x has quietness `q`.

Now, return `answer`, where `answer[x] = y` if `y` is the least quiet person (that is, the person `y` with the smallest value of `quiet[y]`), among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than person `x`.

Explanation: 
answer[0] = 5.

Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.

The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but
it isn't clear if they have more money than person 0.

Each car `i` has a constant speed `speed[i]` (in miles per hour), and initial position `position[i]` miles towards the target along the road.

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it, and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed.

The distance between these two cars is ignored - they are assumed to have the same position.

A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed.  Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

How many car fleets will arrive at the destination?

Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 and 8 become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.

The car starting at 0 doesn't catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.

865,Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes,"Given the `root` of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

Return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree.

A node is called the deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The subtree of a node is tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

Note: This question is the same as 1123: https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/

Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.

The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.

Notice that nodes 5, 3 and 2 contain the deepest nodes in the tree but node 2 is the smallest subtree among them, so we return it.

Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree.


Example 3:
Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]

Two `1`'s are adjacent if there are only `0`'s separating them (possibly no `0`'s). The distance between two `1`'s is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two `1`'s in `""1001""` have a distance of 3.


Example 1:
Input: n = 22
Output: 2
Explanation: 22 in binary is ""10110"".

The first adjacent pair of 1's is ""10110"" with a distance of 2.

The second adjacent pair of 1's is ""10110"" with a distance of 1.

The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.

871,Minimum Number of Refueling Stops,"A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is `target` miles east of the starting position.

Along the way, there are gas stations.  Each `station[i]` represents a gas station that is `station[i][0]` miles east of the starting position, and has `station[i][1]` liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has `startFuel` liters of fuel in it.  It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives.

When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

What is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination?  If it cannot reach the destination, return `-1`.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there.  If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.


Example 1:
Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
Output: 0
Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.


Example 2:
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]

Example 3:
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
We start with 10 liters of fuel.

We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas.

Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),

You know that there exists a floor `f` where `0 <= f <= n` such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than `f` will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor `f` will not break.

Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor `x` (where `1 <= x <= n`). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.

Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of `f` is.

You start on square `1` of the board (which is always in the last row and first column).  Each move, starting from square `x`, consists of the following:
You choose a destination square `S` with number `x+1`, `x+2`, `x+3`, `x+4`, `x+5`, or `x+6`, provided this number is `<= N*N`.

	
(This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.)
If `S` has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to `S`.

A board square on row `r` and column `c` has a ""snake or ladder"" if `board[r][c] != -1`.  The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`.

Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not continue moving.  (For example, if the board is `[[4,-1],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move your destination square is `2`, then you finish your first move at `3`, because you do not continue moving to `4`.)
Return the least number of moves required to reach square N*N.  If it is not possible, return `-1`.

Explanation: 
At the beginning, you start at square 1 [at row 5, column 0].

913,Cat and Mouse,"A game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that `ab` is an edge of the graph.

The mouse starts at node `1` and goes first, the cat starts at node `2` and goes second, and there is a hole at node `0`.

During each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are.  For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in `graph[1]`.

Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)
Then, the game can end in three ways:
If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.

If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.

If ever a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.

Given a `graph`, and assuming both players play optimally, return
`1` if the mouse wins the game,
`2` if the cat wins the game, or
`0` if the game is a draw.

947,Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column,"On a 2D plane, we place `n` stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of the `ith` stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.


Example 1:
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].

2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].

3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].

4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].

5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].

Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.


Example 2:
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to make 3 moves is as follows:

2. Remove stone [2,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].

3. Remove stone [0,2] because it shares the same row as [0,0].

948,Bag of Tokens,"You have an initial power of `P`, an initial score of `0`, and a bag of `tokens` where `tokens[i]` is the value of the `ith` token (0-indexed).

Your goal is to maximize your total score by potentially playing each token in one of two ways:
If your current power is at least `tokens[i]`, you may play the `ith` token face up, losing `tokens[i]` power and gaining `1` score.

If your current score is at least `1`, you may play the `ith` token face down, gaining `tokens[i]` power and losing `1` score.

Each token may be played at most once and in any order. You do not have to play all the tokens.

Return the largest possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.


Example 1:
Input: tokens = [100], P = 50
Output: 0
Explanation: Playing the only token in the bag is impossible because you either have too little power or too little score.


Example 2:
Input: tokens = [100,200], P = 150
Output: 1
Explanation: Play the 0th token (100) face up, your power becomes 50 and score becomes 1.

There is no need to play the 1st token since you cannot play it face up to add to your score.


Example 3:
Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], P = 200
Output: 2
Explanation: Play the tokens in this order to get a score of 2:
1. Play the 0th token (100) face up, your power becomes 100 and score becomes 1.

2. Play the 3rd token (400) face down, your power becomes 500 and score becomes 0.

964,Least Operators to Express Number,"Given a single positive integer `x`, we will write an expression of the form `x (op1) x (op2) x (op3) x ...` where each operator `op1`, `op2`, etc. is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/)`. For example, with `x = 3`, we might write `3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3` which is a value of 3.

When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:
The division operator (`/`) returns rational numbers.

There are no parentheses placed anywhere.

We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.

It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (`-`). For example, ""`x - x`"" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but ""`-x + x`"" is not because it uses negation.

We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given `target`. Return the least number of operators used.


Example 1:
Input: x = 3, target = 19
Output: 5
Explanation: 3 * 3 + 3 * 3 + 3 / 3.

966,Vowel Spellchecker,"Given a `wordlist`, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query word into a correct word.

For a given `query` word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:
Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.

	

Example: `wordlist = [""yellow""]`, `query = ""YellOw""`: `correct = ""yellow""`

Example: `wordlist = [""Yellow""]`, `query = ""yellow""`: `correct = ""Yellow""`

Example: `wordlist = [""yellow""]`, `query = ""yellow""`: `correct = ""yellow""`
Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels `('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')` of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.

	

Example: `wordlist = [""YellOw""]`, `query = ""yollow""`: `correct = ""YellOw""`

Example: `wordlist = [""YellOw""]`, `query = ""yeellow""`: `correct = """"` (no match)

Example: `wordlist = [""YellOw""]`, `query = ""yllw""`: `correct = """"` (no match)
In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules:
When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), you should return the same word back.

When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.

When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.

If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.

Given some `queries`, return a list of words `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the correct word for `query = queries[i]`.


Example 1:
Input: wordlist = [""KiTe"",""kite"",""hare"",""Hare""], queries = [""kite"",""Kite"",""KiTe"",""Hare"",""HARE"",""Hear"",""hear"",""keti"",""keet"",""keto""]

For example, if `arr = [3,2,1,4]` and we performed a pancake flip choosing `k = 3`, we reverse the sub-array `[3,2,1]`, so `arr = [1,2,3,4]` after the pancake flip at `k = 3`.

Return an array of the `k`-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort `arr`. Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * arr.length` flips will be judged as correct.

Any node in the binary tree can be flipped by swapping its left and right subtrees. For example, flipping node 1 will have the following effect:
Flip the smallest number of nodes so that the pre-order traversal of the tree matches `voyage`.

Return a list of the values of all flipped nodes. You may return the answer in any order. If it is impossible to flip the nodes in the tree to make the pre-order traversal match `voyage`, return the list `[-1]`.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2], voyage = [2,1]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: It is impossible to flip the nodes such that the pre-order traversal matches voyage.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,3,2]

972,Equal Rational Numbers,"Given two strings `s` and `t`, each of which represents a non-negative rational number, return `true` if and only if they represent the same number. The strings may use parentheses to denote the repeating part of the rational number.

A rational number can be represented using up to three parts: `<IntegerPart>`, `<NonRepeatingPart>`, and a `<RepeatingPart>`. The number will be represented in one of the following three ways:
`<IntegerPart>`
	
For example, `12`, `0`, and `123`.

`<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart>`
	
For example, `0.5`, `1.`, `2.12`, and `123.0001`.

`<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart><(><RepeatingPart><)>`
	
For example, `0.1(6)`, `1.(9)`, `123.00(1212)`.

The repeating portion of a decimal expansion is conventionally denoted within a pair of round brackets. For example:
`1/6 = 0.16666666... = 0.1(6) = 0.1666(6) = 0.166(66)`.


Example 1:

975,Odd Even Jump,"You are given an integer array `arr`. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.

You may jump forward from index `i` to index `j` (with `i < j`) in the following way:
During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] <= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.

During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] >= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.

It may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps.

A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index `arr.length - 1`) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).

Return the number of good starting indices.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.

From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.

From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.

From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.

In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
jumps.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].

During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].

We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.

In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.

From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.

From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.

From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.

In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some
number of jumps.

983,Minimum Cost For Tickets,"In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance.  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array `days`.  Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:
a 1-day pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars;
a 7-day pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars;
a 30-day pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of `days`.


Example 1:
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]

A closed interval `[a, b]` (with `a < b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.

For each node at position `(row, col)`, its left and right children will be at positions `(row + 1, col - 1)` and `(row + 1, col + 1)` respectively. The root of the tree is at `(0, 0)`.

The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.

Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Explanation:
Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.

Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.

Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.

Explanation:
Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column.

Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.

Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.

          1 is at the top, so it comes first.

          5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.

Column 1: Only node 3 is in this column.

Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.

A move consists of merging exactly `K` consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these `K` piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2

You are also given an array of lamp positions `lamps`, where `lamps[i] = [rowi, coli]` indicates that the lamp at `grid[rowi][coli]` is turned on. When a lamp is turned on, it illuminates its cell and all other cells in the same row, column, or diagonal.

Finally, you are given a query array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [rowi, coli]`. For the `ith` query, determine whether `grid[rowi][coli]` is illuminated or not. After answering the `ith` query, turn off the lamp at `grid[rowi][coli]` and its 8 adjacent lamps if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with `grid[rowi][coli]`.

Return an array of integers `ans`, where `ans[i]` should be `1` if the lamp in the `ith` query was illuminated, or `0` if the lamp was not.


Example 1:
Input: N = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: We have the initial grid with all lamps turned off. In the above picture we see the grid after turning on the lamp at grid[0][0] then turning on the lamp at grid[4][4].

The 0th query asks if the lamp at grid[1][1] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is illuminated, so set ans[0] = 1. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red square.

The 1st query asks if the lamp at grid[1][0] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is not illuminated, so set ans[1] = 0. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red rectangle.

1006,Clumsy Factorial,"Normally, the factorial of a positive integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.  For example, `factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`.

We instead make a clumsy factorial: using the integers in decreasing order, we swap out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations: multiply (*), divide (/), add (+) and subtract (-) in this order.

For example, `clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1`.  However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic: we do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.

Additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that `10 * 9 / 8` equals `11`.  This guarantees the result is an integer.

1040,Moving Stones Until Consecutive II,"On an infinite number line, the position of the i-th stone is given by `stones[i]`.  Call a stone an endpoint stone if it has the smallest or largest position.

Each turn, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone.

In particular, if the stones are at say, `stones = [1,2,5]`, you cannot move the endpoint stone at position 5, since moving it to any position (such as 0, or 3) will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone.

The game ends when you cannot make any more moves, ie. the stones are in consecutive positions.

When the game ends, what is the minimum and maximum number of moves that you could have made?  Return the answer as an length 2 array: `answer = [minimum_moves, maximum_moves]`

Example 1:
Input: [7,4,9]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: 
We can move 4 -> 8 for one move to finish the game.

Or, we can move 9 -> 5, 4 -> 6 for two moves to finish the game.


Example 2:

Output: [2,3]
We can move 3 -> 8 then 10 -> 7 to finish the game.

Or, we can move 3 -> 7, 4 -> 8, 5 -> 9 to finish the game.

Notice we cannot move 10 -> 2 to finish the game, because that would be an illegal move.

Our goal is to assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the (worker, bike) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other, and assign the bike to that worker. (If there are multiple (worker, bike) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker index; if there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest bike index). We repeat this process until there are no available workers.

The Manhattan distance between two points `p1` and `p2` is `Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|`.

Return a vector `ans` of length `N`, where `ans[i]` is the index (0-indexed) of the bike that the `i`-th worker is assigned to.

You may recall that an array `A` is a mountain array if and only if:
`A.length >= 3`
There exists some `i` with `0 < i < A.length - 1` such that:
	
`A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i]`

Given a mountain array `mountainArr`, return the minimum `index` such that `mountainArr.get(index) == target`.  If such an `index` doesn't exist, return `-1`.

You can't access the mountain array directly.  You may only access the array using a `MountainArray` interface:
`MountainArray.get(k)` returns the element of the array at index `k` (0-indexed).

`MountainArray.length()` returns the length of the array.

We have a list of `logs`, where each `logs[i] = [timestamp, id_A, id_B]` contains a non-negative integer timestamp, and the ids of two different people.

Each log represents the time in which two different people became friends.  Friendship is symmetric: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A.

Let's say that person A is acquainted with person B if A is friends with B, or A is a friend of someone acquainted with B.

Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. Return -1 if there is no such earliest time.

The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].

The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107 and after 2 and 3 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].

The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].

The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already friend anything happens.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)
If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.  If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

1223,Dice Roll Simulation,"A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number `i` more than `rollMax[i]` (1-indexed) consecutive times. 
Given an array of integers `rollMax` and an integer `n`, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact `n` rolls.

Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]

Explanation: There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.

While the exact formula is hidden, the function is monotonically increasing, i.e.:
`f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)`
`f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)`
The function interface is defined like this:
interface CustomFunction {
public:
  // Returns some positive integer f(x, y) for two positive integers x and y based on a formula.

1298,Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes,"Given `n` boxes, each box is given in the format `[status, candies, keys, containedBoxes]` where:
`status[i]`: an integer which is 1 if `box[i]` is open and 0 if `box[i]` is closed.

`candies[i]`: an integer representing the number of candies in `box[i]`.

`keys[i]`: an array contains the indices of the boxes you can open with the key in `box[i]`.

`containedBoxes[i]`: an array contains the indices of the boxes found in `box[i]`.

You will start with some boxes given in `initialBoxes` array. You can take all the candies in any open box and you can use the keys in it to open new boxes and you also can use the boxes you find in it.

Return the maximum number of candies you can get following the rules above.


Example 1:
Input: status = [1,0,1,0], candies = [7,5,4,100], keys = [[],[],[1],[]], containedBoxes = [[1,2],[3],[],[]], initialBoxes = [0]
Output: 16
Explanation: You will be initially given box 0. You will find 7 candies in it and boxes 1 and 2. Box 1 is closed and you don't have a key for it so you will open box 2. You will find 4 candies and a key to box 1 in box 2.

In box 1, you will find 5 candies and box 3 but you will not find a key to box 3 so box 3 will remain closed.

Total number of candies collected = 7 + 4 + 5 = 16 candy.

Input: status = [1,0,0,0,0,0], candies = [1,1,1,1,1,1], keys = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]], containedBoxes = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [0]
Output: 6
Explanation: You have initially box 0. Opening it you can find boxes 1,2,3,4 and 5 and their keys. The total number of candies will be 6.


Example 3:
Input: status = [1,1,1], candies = [100,1,100], keys = [[],[0,2],[]], containedBoxes = [[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [1]

1333,"Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance","Given the array `restaurants` where  `restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi, veganFriendlyi, pricei, distancei]`. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.

The `veganFriendly` filter will be either true (meaning you should only include restaurants with `veganFriendlyi` set to true) or false (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters `maxPrice` and `maxDistance` which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.

Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from highest to lowest. For simplicity `veganFriendlyi` and `veganFriendly` take value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.


Example 1:
Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
Output: [3,1,5] 
Explanation: 
The restaurants are:
Restaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10]
Restaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5]
Restaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4]
Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]
Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1] 
After filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest).

The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news. He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform their subordinates, and so on until all employees know about the urgent news.

The `i-th` employee needs `informTime[i]` minutes to inform all of his direct subordinates (i.e., After informTime[i] minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).

Return the number of minutes needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1, headID = 0, manager = [-1], informTime = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: The head of the company is the only employee in the company.


Example 2:
Input: n = 6, headID = 2, manager = [2,2,-1,2,2,2], informTime = [0,0,1,0,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The head of the company with id = 2 is the direct manager of all the employees in the company and needs 1 minute to inform them all.

The tree structure of the employees in the company is shown.


Example 3:
Input: n = 7, headID = 6, manager = [1,2,3,4,5,6,-1], informTime = [0,6,5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 21
Explanation: The head has id = 6. He will inform employee with id = 5 in 1 minute.

The employee with id = 5 will inform the employee with id = 4 in 2 minutes.

The employee with id = 4 will inform the employee with id = 3 in 3 minutes.

The employee with id = 3 will inform the employee with id = 2 in 4 minutes.

The employee with id = 2 will inform the employee with id = 1 in 5 minutes.

The employee with id = 1 will inform the employee with id = 0 in 6 minutes.

Needed time = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.


Example 4:
Input: n = 15, headID = 0, manager = [-1,0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6], informTime = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first minute the head will inform employees 1 and 2.

The second minute they will inform employees 3, 4, 5 and 6.

The third minute they will inform the rest of employees.

1377,Frog Position After T Seconds,"Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `1` to `n`. A frog starts jumping from vertex 1. In one second, the frog jumps from its current vertex to another unvisited vertex if they are directly connected. The frog can not jump back to a visited vertex. In case the frog can jump to several vertices, it jumps randomly to one of them with the same probability. Otherwise, when the frog can not jump to any unvisited vertex, it jumps forever on the same vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` means that exists an edge connecting the vertices `ai` and `bi`.

Return the probability that after `t` seconds the frog is on the vertex `target`.

Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 2, target = 4
Output: 0.16666666666666666 
Explanation: The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 probability to the vertex 2 after second 1 and then jumping with 1/2 probability to vertex 4 after second 2. Thus the probability for the frog is on the vertex 4 after 2 seconds is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 = 0.16666666666666666.

1406,Stone Game III,"Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array `stoneValue`.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2 or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.

The score of each player is the sum of values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.

The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return ""Alice"" if Alice will win, ""Bob"" if Bob will win or ""Tie"" if they end the game with the same score.


Example 1:
Input: values = [1,2,3,7]
Output: ""Bob""
Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.


Example 2:
Input: values = [1,2,3,-9]
Output: ""Alice""
Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.

If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.

If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.

Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.


Example 3:
Input: values = [1,2,3,6]
Output: ""Tie""
Explanation: Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.

1458,Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences,"Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.

Return the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.

A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `[2,3,5]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,3,4,5]` while `[1,5,3]` is not).


Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6]

A value `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than a value `arr[j]` if `|arr[i] - m| > |arr[j] - m|` where `m` is the median of the array.

If `|arr[i] - m| == |arr[j] - m|`, then `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than `arr[j]` if `arr[i] > arr[j]`.

Return a list of the strongest `k` values in the array. return the answer in any arbitrary order.

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is n, the median is the element in position `((n - 1) / 2)` in the sorted list (0-indexed).

For `arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11]`, `n = 5` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11]` and the median is `arr[m]` where `m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2`. The median is `6`.

For `arr = [-7, 22, 17, 3]`, `n = 4` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22]` and the median is `arr[m]` where `m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1`. The median is `3`.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

1483,Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node,"You are given a tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` in the form of a parent array where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. The root of the tree is node `0`.

Implement the function `getKthAncestor``(int node, int k)` to return the `k`-th ancestor of the given `node`. If there is no such ancestor, return `-1`.

The k-th ancestor of a tree node is the `k`-th node in the path from that node to the root.


Example:
Input:
[""TreeAncestor"",""getKthAncestor"",""getKthAncestor"",""getKthAncestor""]
[[7,[-1,0,0,1,1,2,2]],[3,1],[5,2],[6,3]]
Output:

Explanation:
TreeAncestor treeAncestor = new TreeAncestor(7, [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]);
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(3, 1);  // returns 1 which is the parent of 3
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(5, 2);  // returns 0 which is the grandparent of 5

1485,Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer,"A binary tree is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the tree or null.

Return a deep copy of the tree.

The tree is represented in the same input/output way as normal binary trees where each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:
`val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
`random_index`: the index of the node (in the input) where the random pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

You will be given the tree in class `Node` and you should return the cloned tree in class `NodeCopy`. `NodeCopy` class is just a clone of `Node` class with the same attributes and constructors.


Example 1:
Input: root = [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Output: [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Explanation: The original binary tree is [1,null,4,7].

The random pointer of node one is null, so it is represented as [1, null].

The random pointer of node 4 is node 7, so it is represented as [4, 3] where 3 is the index of node 7 in the array representing the tree.

The random pointer of node 7 is node 1, so it is represented as [7, 0] where 0 is the index of node 1 in the array representing the tree.


Example 2:
Input: root = [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]
Output: [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]
Explanation: The random pointer of a node can be the node itself.


Example 3:
Input: root = [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]
Output: [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]

1487,Making File Names Unique,"Given an array of strings `names` of size `n`. You will create `n` folders in your file system such that, at the `ith` minute, you will create a folder with the name `names[i]`.

Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name which is previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of `(k)`, where, `k` is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name remains unique.

Return an array of strings of length `n` where `ans[i]` is the actual name the system will assign to the `ith` folder when you create it.


Example 1:
Input: names = [""pes"",""fifa"",""gta"",""pes(2019)""]
Output: [""pes"",""fifa"",""gta"",""pes(2019)""]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
""pes"" --> not assigned before, remains ""pes""
""fifa"" --> not assigned before, remains ""fifa""
""gta"" --> not assigned before, remains ""gta""
""pes(2019)"" --> not assigned before, remains ""pes(2019)""

Example 2:
Input: names = [""gta"",""gta(1)"",""gta"",""avalon""]
Output: [""gta"",""gta(1)"",""gta(2)"",""avalon""]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
""gta"" --> not assigned before, remains ""gta""
""gta(1)"" --> not assigned before, remains ""gta(1)""
""gta"" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since ""gta(1)"" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes ""gta(2)""
""avalon"" --> not assigned before, remains ""avalon""

Example 3:
Input: names = [""onepiece"",""onepiece(1)"",""onepiece(2)"",""onepiece(3)"",""onepiece""]
Output: [""onepiece"",""onepiece(1)"",""onepiece(2)"",""onepiece(3)"",""onepiece(4)""]
Explanation: When the last folder is created, the smallest positive valid k is 4, and it becomes ""onepiece(4)"".


Example 4:
Input: names = [""wano"",""wano"",""wano"",""wano""]
Output: [""wano"",""wano(1)"",""wano(2)"",""wano(3)""]
Explanation: Just increase the value of k each time you create folder ""wano"".


Example 5:
Input: names = [""kaido"",""kaido(1)"",""kaido"",""kaido(1)""]
Output: [""kaido"",""kaido(1)"",""kaido(2)"",""kaido(1)(1)""]

1488,Avoid Flood in The City,"Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the `nth` lake, the `nth` lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake which is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.

Given an integer array `rains` where:
`rains[i] > 0` means there will be rains over the `rains[i]` lake.

`rains[i] == 0` means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.

Return an array `ans` where:
`ans.length == rains.length`
`ans[i] == -1` if `rains[i] > 0`.

`ans[i]` is the lake you choose to dry in the `ith` day if `rains[i] == 0`.

If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.

Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)

Example 1:
Input: rains = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.


Example 2:
Input: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]
Output: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.

After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].

After the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].

It is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.


Example 3:
Input: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]
Output: []
Explanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.

After that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.


Example 4:
Input: rains = [69,0,0,0,69]
Output: [-1,69,1,1,-1]
Explanation: Any solution on one of the forms [-1,69,x,y,-1], [-1,x,69,y,-1] or [-1,x,y,69,-1] is acceptable where 1 <= x,y <= 10^9

Example 5:

1489,Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree,"Given a weighted undirected connected graph with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.


Example 1:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.

The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:
Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.

The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.


Constraints:

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`. Return `True` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `False`, assuming both players play optimally.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.

1516,Move Sub-Tree of N-Ary Tree,"Given the `root` of an N-ary tree of unique values, and two nodes of the tree `p` and `q`.

You should move the subtree of the node `p` to become a direct child of node `q`. If `p` is already a direct child of `q`, don't change anything. Node `p` must be the last child in the children list of node `q`.

Return the root of the tree after adjusting it.

There are 3 cases for nodes `p` and `q`:
Node `q` is in the sub-tree of node `p`.

Node `p` is in the sub-tree of node `q`.

Neither node `p` is in the sub-tree of node `q` nor node `q` is in the sub-tree of node `p`.

In cases 2 and 3, you just need to move `p` (with its sub-tree) to be a child of `q`, but in case 1 the tree may be disconnected, thus you need to reconnect the tree again. Please read the examples carefully before solving this problem.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

For example, the above tree is serialized as [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14].


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 4, q = 1
Output: [1,null,2,3,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,8]
Explanation: This example follows the second case as node p is in the sub-tree of node q. We move node p with its sub-tree to be a direct child of node q.

Notice that node 4 is the last child of node 1.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 7, q = 4
Output: [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8]
Explanation: Node 7 is already a direct child of node 4. We don't change anything.


Example 3:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 3, q = 8
Output: [1,null,2,null,4,5,null,7,8,null,null,null,3,null,6]
Explanation: This example follows case 3 because node p is not in the sub-tree of node q and vice-versa. We can move node 3 with its sub-tree and make it as node 8's child.


Example 4:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 2, q = 7
Output: [1,null,7,3,null,2,null,6,null,4,5,null,null,8]
Explanation: Node q is in the sub-tree of node p, so this is case 1.

The first step, we move node p (with all of its sub-tree except for node q) and add it as a child to node q.

Then we will see that the tree is disconnected, you need to reconnect node q to replace node p as shown.


Example 5:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 1, q = 2
Output: [2,null,4,5,1,null,7,8,null,null,3,null,null,null,6]
Explanation: Node q is in the sub-tree of node p, so this is case 1.

The first step, we move node p (with all of its sub-tree except for node q) and add it as a child to node q.

As node p was the root of the tree, node q replaces it and becomes the root of the tree.


Constraints:

Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3]], labels = ""bbbb""
Output: [4,2,1,1]
Explanation: The sub-tree of node 2 contains only node 2, so the answer is 1.

The sub-tree of node 3 contains only node 3, so the answer is 1.

The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, both have label 'b', thus the answer is 2.

The sub-tree of node 0 contains nodes 0, 1, 2 and 3, all with label 'b', thus the answer is 4.

1520,Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Substrings,"Given a string `s` of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of non-empty substrings of `s` that meet the following conditions:
The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings `s[i..j]` and `s[k..l]`, either `j < k` or `i > l` is true.

A substring that contains a certain character `c` must also contain all occurrences of `c`.

Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.

Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""adefaddaccc""
Output: [""e"",""f"",""ccc""]
Explanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:
[
  ""adefaddaccc""
  ""adefadda"",
  ""ef"",
  ""e"",
  ""f"",
  ""ccc"",
]
If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose ""adefadda"", we are left with ""ccc"" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose ""ef"" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [""e"",""f"",""ccc""] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.

1531,String Compression II,"Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string `""aabccc""` we replace `""aa""` by `""a2""` and replace `""ccc""` by `""c3""`. Thus the compressed string becomes `""a2bc3""`.

Notice that in this problem, we are not adding `'1'` after single characters.

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to delete at most `k` characters from `s` such that the run-length encoded version of `s` has minimum length.

Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of `s` after deleting at most `k` characters.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""aaabcccd"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us ""a3bc3d"" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = ""abcccd"" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be ""a3c3"" of length 4.


Example 2:
Input: s = ""aabbaa"", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be ""a4"" of length 2.


Example 3:
Input: s = ""aaaaaaaaaaa"", k = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is ""a11"" of length 3.

1533,Find the Index of the Large Integer,"We have an integer array `arr`, where all the integers in `arr` are equal except for one integer which is larger than the rest of the integers. You will not be given direct access to the array, instead, you will have an API `ArrayReader` which have the following functions:
`int compareSub(int l, int r, int x, int y)`: where `0 <= l, r, x, y < ArrayReader.length()`, `l <= r and` `x <= y`. The function compares the sum of sub-array `arr[l..r]` with the sum of the sub-array `arr[x..y]` and returns:
	
1 if `arr[l]+arr[l+1]+...+arr[r] > arr[x]+arr[x+1]+...+arr[y]`.

0 if `arr[l]+arr[l+1]+...+arr[r] == arr[x]+arr[x+1]+...+arr[y]`.

-1 if `arr[l]+arr[l+1]+...+arr[r] < arr[x]+arr[x+1]+...+arr[y]`.

`int length()`: Returns the size of the array.

You are allowed to call `compareSub()` 20 times at most. You can assume both functions work in `O(1)` time.

Return the index of the array `arr` which has the largest integer.

Follow-up:
What if there are two numbers in `arr` that are bigger than all other numbers?
What if there is one number that is bigger than other numbers and one number that is smaller than other numbers?

Example 1:
Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,10,7,7,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: The following calls to the API
reader.compareSub(0, 0, 1, 1) // returns 0 this is a query comparing the sub-array (0, 0) with the sub array (1, 1), (i.e. compares arr[0] with arr[1]).

Thus we know that arr[0] and arr[1] doesn't contain the largest element.

reader.compareSub(2, 2, 3, 3) // returns 0, we can exclude arr[2] and arr[3].

reader.compareSub(4, 4, 5, 5) // returns 1, thus for sure arr[4] is the largest element in the array.

Notice that we made only 3 calls, so the answer is valid.

1540,Can Convert String in K Moves,"Given two strings `s` and `t`, your goal is to convert `s` into `t` in `k` moves or less.

During the `ith` (`1 <= i <= k`) move you can:
Choose any index `j` (1-indexed) from `s`, such that `1 <= j <= s.length` and `j` has not been chosen in any previous move, and shift the character at that index `i` times.

Do nothing.

Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`). Shifting a character by `i` means applying the shift operations `i` times.

Remember that any index `j` can be picked at most once.

Return `true` if it's possible to convert `s` into `t` in no more than `k` moves, otherwise return `false`.

Given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Return the minimum total cost of the cuts.


Example 1:
Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]

Explanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:
The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.

Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).

The warehouse's rooms are labelled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where `warehouse[i]` (0-indexed) is the height of the `ith` room.

Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:
Boxes cannot be stacked.

You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.

Boxes can only be pushed into the warehouse from left to right only.

If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.

Return the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.


Example 1:
Input: boxes = [4,3,4,1], warehouse = [5,3,3,4,1]

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
1 -> 3
1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

Example 2:
Input: locations = [4,3,1], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: The following are all possible routes:
1 -> 0, used fuel = 1
1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5

Example 3:
Input: locations = [5,2,1], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: It's impossible to get from 0 to 2 using only 3 units of fuel since the shortest route needs 4 units of fuel.


Example 4:
Input: locations = [2,1,5], start = 0, finish = 0, fuel = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two possible routes, 0 and 0 -> 1 -> 0.


Example 5:
Input: locations = [1,2,3], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 40
Output: 615088286
Explanation: The total number of possible routes is 2615088300. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives us 615088286.

Return the minimum cost of deletions such that there are no two identical letters next to each other.

Notice that you will delete the chosen characters at the same time, in other words, after deleting a character, the costs of deleting other characters will not change.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""abaac"", cost = [1,2,3,4,5]

1579,Remove Max Number of Edges to Keep Graph Fully Traversable,"Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of `n` nodes and 3 types of edges:
Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.

Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.

Type 3: Can by traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Given an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [typei, ui, vi]` represents a bidirectional edge of type `typei` between nodes `ui` and `vi`, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.

Return the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return `-1` if it's impossible for the graph to be fully traversed by Alice and Bob.


Example 1:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,3],[1,2,4],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3]. The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob. Removing any additional edge will not make it so. So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,4],[2,1,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Notice that removing any edge will not make the graph fully traversable by Alice and Bob.


Example 3:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,2,3],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]

1580,Put Boxes Into the Warehouse II,"You are given two arrays of positive integers, `boxes` and `warehouse`, representing the heights of some boxes of unit width and the heights of `n` rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where `warehouse[i]` (0-indexed) is the height of the `ith` room.

Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:
Boxes cannot be stacked.

You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.

Boxes can be pushed into the warehouse from either side (left or right)
If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.

Return the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.


Example 1:
Input: boxes = [1,2,2,3,4], warehouse = [3,4,1,2]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can store the boxes in the following order:
1- Put the yellow box in room 2 from either the left or right side.

2- Put the orange box in room 3 from the right side.

3- Put the green box in room 1 from the left side.

4- Put the red box in room 0 from the left side.

Notice that there are other valid ways to put 4 boxes such as swapping the red and green boxes or the red and orange boxes.


Example 2:
Input: boxes = [3,5,5,2], warehouse = [2,1,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
It's not possible to put the two boxes of height 5 in the warehouse since there's only 1 room of height >= 5.

Other valid solutions are to put the green box in room 2 or to put the orange box first in room 2 before putting the green and red boxes.

For example, applying the operation on the underlined substring in `""14234""` results in `""12344""`.

Return `true` if it is possible to transform string `s` into string `t`. Otherwise, return `false`.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.


Example 1:

1586,Binary Search Tree Iterator II,"Implement the `BSTIterator` class that represents an iterator over the in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST):
`BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The `root` of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.

`boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.

`int next()` Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

`boolean hasPrev()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the left of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.

`int prev()` Moves the pointer to the left, then returns the number at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to `next()` will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that `next()` and `prev()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next/previous number in the in-order traversal when `next()`/`prev()` is called.

Return the maximum total sum of all requests among all permutations of `nums`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], requests = [[1,3],[0,1]]

Output: 1
Explanation: The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9

Output: [+,-,1,2,/,null,null,null,null,3,*,null,null,5,2]
Explanation: The inorder traversal of the tree above is 2-3/5*2+1 which is the same as s without the parenthesis. The tree also produces the correct result and its operands are in the same order as they appear in s.

The tree below is also a valid binary expression tree with the same inorder traversal as s, but it not a valid answer because it does not evaluate to the same value.

The third tree below is also not valid. Although it produces the same result and is equivalent to the above trees, its inorder traversal does not produce s and its operands are not in the same order as s.

1599,Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel,"You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, and each gondola has room for up to four people. You have the ability to rotate the gondolas counterclockwise, which costs you `runningCost` dollars.

You are given an array `customers` of length `n` where `customers[i]` is the number of new customers arriving just before the `ith` rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel `i` times before the `customers[i]` customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays `boardingCost` dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.

You can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.

Return the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: customers = [8,3], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.

1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $5 - 1 * $6 = $14.

2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $5 - 2 * $6 = $28.

3. The final 3 customers board the gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $5 - 3 * $6 = $37.

The highest profit was $37 after rotating the wheel 3 times.


Example 2:
Input: customers = [10,9,6], boardingCost = 6, runningCost = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $6 - 1 * $4 = $20.

2. 9 customers arrive, 4 board and 11 wait (2 originally waiting, 9 newly waiting), the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $6 - 2 * $4 = $40.

3. The final 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $6 - 3 * $4 = $60.

4. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $6 - 4 * $4 = $80.

5. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $6 - 5 * $4 = $100.

6. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $6 - 6 * $4 = $120.

7. 1 boards, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 25 * $6 - 7 * $4 = $122.

The highest profit was $122 after rotating the wheel 7 times.


Example 3:
Input: customers = [3,4,0,5,1], boardingCost = 1, runningCost = 92
Output: -1
Explanation:
1. 3 customers arrive, 3 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 3 * $1 - 1 * $92 = -$89.

2. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 2 * $92 = -$177.

3. 0 customers arrive, 0 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 3 * $92 = -$269.

4. 5 customers arrive, 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $1 - 4 * $92 = -$357.

5. 1 customer arrives, 2 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 13 * $1 - 5 * $92 = -$447.

The profit was never positive, so return -1.


Example 4:
Input: customers = [10,10,6,4,7], boardingCost = 3, runningCost = 8
Output: 9
Explanation:
1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $3 - 1 * $8 = $4.

2. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 12 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $3 - 2 * $8 = $8.

3. 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 14 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $3 - 3 * $8 = $12.

4. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 14 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $3 - 4 * $8 = $16.

5. 7 customers arrive, 4 board and 17 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $3 - 5 * $8 = $20.

6. 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $3 - 6 * $8 = $24.

7. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 28 * $3 - 7 * $8 = $28.

8. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 32 * $3 - 8 * $8 = $32.

9. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 36 * $3 - 9 * $8 = $36.

10. 1 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 37 * $3 - 10 * $8 = $31.

1600,Throne Inheritance,"A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.

The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function `Successor(x, curOrder)`, which given a person `x` and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after `x` in the order of inheritance.

Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null
        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)
    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder
For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.

In the beginning, `curOrder` will be `[""king""]`.

Calling `Successor(king, curOrder)` will return Alice, so we append to `curOrder` to get `[""king"", ""Alice""]`.

Calling `Successor(Alice, curOrder)` will return Jack, so we append to `curOrder` to get `[""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack""]`.

Calling `Successor(Jack, curOrder)` will return Bob, so we append to `curOrder` to get `[""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""]`.

Calling `Successor(Bob, curOrder)` will return `null`. Thus the order of inheritance will be `[""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""]`.

Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.

Implement the `ThroneInheritance` class:
`ThroneInheritance(string kingName)` Initializes an object of the `ThroneInheritance` class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.

`void birth(string parentName, string childName)` Indicates that `parentName` gave birth to `childName`.

`void death(string name)` Indicates the death of `name`. The death of the person doesn't affect the `Successor` function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.

`string[] getInheritanceOrder()` Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.

Input

You are given an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents an employee's request to transfer from building `fromi` to building `toi`.

All buildings are full, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the net change in employee transfers is zero. This means the number of employees leaving is equal to the number of employees moving in. For example if `n = 3` and two employees are leaving building `0`, one is leaving building `1`, and one is leaving building `2`, there should be two employees moving to building `0`, one employee moving to building `1`, and one employee moving to building `2`.

1606,Find Servers That Handled Most Number of Requests,"You have `k` servers numbered from `0` to `k-1` that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:
The `ith` (0-indexed) request arrives.

If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).

If the `(i % k)th` server is available, assign the request to that server.

Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the `ith` server is busy, try to assign the request to the `(i+1)th` server, then the `(i+2)th` server, and so on.

You are given a strictly increasing array `arrival` of positive integers, where `arrival[i]` represents the arrival time of the `ith` request, and another array `load`, where `load[i]` represents the load of the `ith` request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.

Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.


Example 1:
Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
Output: [1] 
Explanation:
All of the servers start out available.

The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.

Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.

Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.

Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.


Example 2:
Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
Output: [0]
Explanation:
The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.

Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.

Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.


Example 3:
Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation: Each server handles a single request, so they are all considered the busiest.

Explanation: The node values on each level are:
Level 0: [1]
Level 1: [10,4]
Level 2: [3,7,9]

1610,Maximum Number of Visible Points,"You are given an array `points`, an integer `angle`, and your `location`, where `location = [posx, posy]` and `points[i] = [xi, yi]` both denote integral coordinates on the X-Y plane.

Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You cannot move from your position, but you can rotate. In other words, `posx` and `posy` cannot be changed. Your field of view in degrees is represented by `angle`, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let `d` be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view is the inclusive range of angles `[d - angle/2, d + angle/2]`.

Your browser does not support the video tag or this video format.

You can see some set of points if, for each point, the angle formed by the point, your position, and the immediate east direction from your position is in your field of view.

There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your location, and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation. Points do not obstruct your vision to other points.

Return the maximum number of points you can see.


Example 1:
Input: points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,3]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]

1612,Check If Two Expression Trees are Equivalent,"A binary expression tree is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (variables), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators. In this problem, we only consider the `'+'` operator (i.e. addition).

You are given the roots of two binary expression trees, `root1` and `root2`. Return `true` if the two binary expression trees are equivalent. Otherwise, return `false`.

Two binary expression trees are equivalent if they evaluate to the same value regardless of what the variables are set to.

The network rank of two different cities is defined as the total number of directly connected roads to either city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted once.

The maximal network rank of the infrastructure is the maximum network rank of all pairs of different cities.

Given the integer `n` and the array `roads`, return the maximal network rank of the entire infrastructure.


Example 1:
Input: n = 4, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The network rank of cities 0 and 1 is 4 as there are 4 roads that are connected to either 0 or 1. The road between 0 and 1 is only counted once.

1616,Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome,"You are given two strings `a` and `b` of the same length. Choose an index and split both strings at the same index, splitting `a` into two strings: `aprefix` and `asuffix` where `a = aprefix + asuffix`, and splitting `b` into two strings: `bprefix` and `bsuffix` where `b = bprefix + bsuffix`. Check if `aprefix + bsuffix` or `bprefix + asuffix` forms a palindrome.

When you split a string `s` into `sprefix` and `ssuffix`, either `ssuffix` or `sprefix` is allowed to be empty. For example, if `s = ""abc""`, then `"""" + ""abc""`, `""a"" + ""bc""`, `""ab"" + ""c""` , and `""abc"" + """"` are valid splits.

Return `true` if it is possible to form a palindrome string, otherwise return `false`.

Notice that `x + y` denotes the concatenation of strings `x` and `y`.


Example 1:
Input: a = ""x"", b = ""y""
Output: true
Explaination: If either a or b are palindromes the answer is true since you can split in the following way:
aprefix = """", asuffix = ""x""
bprefix = """", bsuffix = ""y""
Then, aprefix + bsuffix = """" + ""y"" = ""y"", which is a palindrome.

You are given an array `edges` of size `n-1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents a bidirectional edge between cities `ui` and `vi`. There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a tree.

A subtree is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.

For each `d` from `1` to `n-1`, find the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities in the subtree is equal to `d`.

Return an array of size `n-1` where the `dth` element (1-indexed) is the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities is equal to `d`.

Notice that the distance between the two cities is the number of edges in the path between them.

You can use the `FontInfo` interface to get the width and height of any character at any available font size.

The `FontInfo` interface is defined as such:
interface FontInfo {
  // Returns the width of character ch on the screen using font size fontSize.

  // O(1) per call
  public int getWidth(int fontSize, char ch);
  // Returns the height of any character on the screen using font size fontSize.

  // O(1) per call
  public int getHeight(int fontSize);
}
The calculated width of `text` for some `fontSize` is the sum of every `getWidth(fontSize, text[i])` call for each `0 <= i < text.length` (0-indexed). The calculated height of `text` for some `fontSize` is `getHeight(fontSize)`. Note that `text` is displayed on a single line.

It is guaranteed that `FontInfo` will return the same value if you call `getHeight` or `getWidth` with the same parameters.

It is also guaranteed that for any font size `fontSize` and any character `ch`:
`getHeight(fontSize) <= getHeight(fontSize+1)`
`getWidth(fontSize, ch) <= getWidth(fontSize+1, ch)`
Return the maximum font size you can use to display `text` on the screen. If `text` cannot fit on the display with any font size, return `-1`.

1620,Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality,"You are given an array of network towers `towers` and an integer `radius`, where `towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi]` denotes the `ith` network tower with location `(xi, yi)` and quality factor `qi`. All the coordinates are integral coordinates on the X-Y plane, and the distance between two coordinates is the Euclidean distance.

The integer `radius` denotes the maximum distance in which the tower is reachable. The tower is reachable if the distance is less than or equal to `radius`. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is not reachable.

The signal quality of the `ith` tower at a coordinate `(x, y)` is calculated with the formula `⌊qi / (1 + d)⌋`, where `d` is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The network quality at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the reachable towers.

Return the integral coordinate where the network quality is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, return the lexicographically minimum coordinate.

Note:
A coordinate `(x1, y1)` is lexicographically smaller than `(x2, y2)` if either `x1 < x2` or `x1 == x2` and `y1 < y2`.

`⌊val⌋` is the greatest integer less than or equal to `val` (the floor function).

all divisors can be used. Since all numbers share 1 as a divisor, all cities are connected.

1628,Design an Expression Tree With Evaluate Function,"Given the `postfix` tokens of an arithmetic expression, build and return the binary expression tree that represents this expression.

Postfix notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which the operands (numbers) appear before their operators. For example, the postfix tokens of the expression `4*(5-(7+2))` are represented in the array `postfix = [""4"",""5"",""7"",""2"",""+"",""-"",""*""]`.

The class `Node` is an interface you should use to implement the binary expression tree. The returned tree will be tested using the `evaluate` function, which is supposed to evaluate the tree's value. You should not remove the `Node` class; however, you can modify it as you wish, and you can define other classes to implement it if needed.

A binary expression tree is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).

It's guaranteed that no subtree will yield a value that exceeds `109` in absolute value, and all the operations are valid (i.e., no division by zero).

Follow up: Could you design the expression tree such that it is more modular? For example, is your design able to support additional operators without making changes to your existing `evaluate` implementation?

Example 1:
Input: s = [""3"",""4"",""+"",""2"",""*"",""7"",""/""]
Output: 2
Explanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression (`(3+4)*2)/7) = 14/7 = 2.`

Example 2:
Input: s = [""4"",""5"",""7"",""2"",""+"",""-"",""*""]
Output: -16
Explanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression 4*(5-`(2+7)) = 4*(-4) = -16.`

Example 3:
Input: s = [""4"",""2"",""+"",""3"",""5"",""1"",""-"",""*"",""+""]
Output: 18

Example 4:

Constraints:
`1 <= s.length < 100`
`s.length` is odd.

`s` consists of numbers and the characters `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.

If `s[i]` is a number, its integer representation is no more than `105`.

1630,Arithmetic Subarrays,"A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence `s` is arithmetic if and only if `s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] `for all valid `i`.

For example, these are arithmetic sequences:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
The following sequence is not arithmetic:
1, 1, 2, 5, 7
You are given an array of `n` integers, `nums`, and two arrays of `m` integers each, `l` and `r`, representing the `m` range queries, where the `ith` query is the range `[l[i], r[i]]`. All the arrays are 0-indexed.

Return a list of `boolean` elements `answer`, where `answer[i]` is `true` if the subarray `nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]]` can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and `false` otherwise.


Example 1:
Input: nums = `[4,6,5,9,3,7]`, l = `[0,0,2]`, r = `[2,3,5]`
Output: `[true,false,true]`
Explanation:
In the 0th query, the subarray is [4,6,5]. This can be rearranged as [6,5,4], which is an arithmetic sequence.

In the 1st query, the subarray is [4,6,5,9]. This cannot be rearranged as an arithmetic sequence.

In the 2nd query, the subarray is `[5,9,3,7]. This` can be rearranged as `[3,5,7,9]`, which is an arithmetic sequence.

You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.


Example 1:
Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.

This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.

1632,Rank Transform of a Matrix,"Given an `m x n` `matrix`, return a new matrix `answer` where `answer[row][col]` is the rank of `matrix[row][col]`.

The rank is an integer that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. It is calculated using the following rules:
The rank is an integer starting from `1`.

If two elements `p` and `q` are in the same row or column, then:
	
If `p < q` then `rank(p) < rank(q)`
If `p == q` then `rank(p) == rank(q)`
If `p > q` then `rank(p) > rank(q)`
The rank should be as small as possible.

It is guaranteed that `answer` is unique under the given rules.


Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [[1,2],[2,3]]
Explanation:
The rank of matrix[0][0] is 1 because it is the smallest integer in its row and column.

The rank of matrix[0][1] is 2 because matrix[0][1] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.

The rank of matrix[1][0] is 2 because matrix[1][0] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.

1634,Add Two Polynomials Represented as Linked Lists,"A polynomial linked list is a special type of linked list where every node represents a term in a polynomial expression.

Each node has three attributes:
`coefficient`: an integer representing the number multiplier of the term. The coefficient of the term `9x4` is `9`.

`power`: an integer representing the exponent. The power of the term `9x4` is `4`.

`next`: a pointer to the next node in the list, or `null` if it is the last node of the list.

For example, the polynomial `5x3 + 4x - 7` is represented by the polynomial linked list illustrated below:
The polynomial linked list must be in its standard form: the polynomial must be in strictly descending order by its `power` value. Also, terms with a `coefficient` of `0` are omitted.

Given two polynomial linked list heads, `poly1` and `poly2`, add the polynomials together and return the head of the sum of the polynomials.

`PolyNode` format:
The input/output format is as a list of `n` nodes, where each node is represented as its `[coefficient, power]`. For example, the polynomial `5x3 + 4x - 7` would be represented as: `[[5,3],[4,1],[-7,0]]`.


Example 1:
Input: poly1 = [[1,1]], poly2 = [[1,0]]

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: ""The lowest common ancestor of two nodes `p` and `q` in a binary tree `T` is the lowest node that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)"". A descendant of a node `x` is a node `y` that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node.

1648,Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls,"You have an `inventory` of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls of any color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls of that color you currently have in your `inventory`. For example, if you own `6` yellow balls, the customer would pay `6` for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `ith` color that you initially own. You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls in any order.

Return the maximum total value that you can attain after selling `orders` colored balls. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: inventory = [2,5], orders = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).

You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you do not have to have all the people living in the grid.

The happiness of each person is calculated as follows:
Introverts start with `120` happiness and lose `30` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Extroverts start with `40` happiness and gain `20` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.

The grid happiness is the sum of each person's happiness. Return the maximum possible grid happiness.


Example 1:
Input: m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2
Output: 240
Explanation: Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).

We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).

- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.

The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.


Example 2:
Input: m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
Output: 260
Explanation: Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).

- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90

1665,Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks,"You are given an array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [actuali, minimumi]`:
`actuali` is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the `ith` task.

`minimumi` is the minimum amount of energy you require to begin the `ith` task.

For example, if the task is `[10, 12]` and your current energy is `11`, you cannot start this task. However, if your current energy is `13`, you can complete this task, and your energy will be `3` after finishing it.

You can finish the tasks in any order you like.

Return the minimum initial amount of energy you will need to finish all the tasks.


Example 1:
Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[4,8]]
Output: 8
Explanation:
Starting with 8 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
    - 3rd task. Now energy = 8 - 4 = 4.

    - 2nd task. Now energy = 4 - 2 = 2.

    - 1st task. Now energy = 2 - 1 = 1.

Notice that even though we have leftover energy, starting with 7 energy does not work because we cannot do the 3rd task.


Example 2:
Input: tasks = [[1,3],[2,4],[10,11],[10,12],[8,9]]
Output: 32
Explanation:
Starting with 32 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
    - 1st task. Now energy = 32 - 1 = 31.

    - 2nd task. Now energy = 31 - 2 = 29.

    - 3rd task. Now energy = 29 - 10 = 19.

    - 4th task. Now energy = 19 - 10 = 9.

    - 5th task. Now energy = 9 - 8 = 1.


Example 3:
Input: tasks = [[1,7],[2,8],[3,9],[4,10],[5,11],[6,12]]
Output: 27
Explanation:
Starting with 27 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
    - 5th task. Now energy = 27 - 5 = 22.

    - 2nd task. Now energy = 22 - 2 = 20.

    - 3rd task. Now energy = 20 - 3 = 17.

    - 1st task. Now energy = 17 - 1 = 16.

You can reroot the tree with the following steps for each node `cur` on the path starting from the `leaf` up to the `root`​​​ excluding the root:
If `cur` has a left child, then that child becomes `cur`'s right child.

`cur`'s original parent becomes `cur`'s left child. Note that in this process the original parent's pointer to `cur` becomes `null`, making it have at most one child.

Return the new root of the rerooted tree.

1670,Design Front Middle Back Queue,"Design a queue that supports `push` and `pop` operations in the front, middle, and back.

Implement the `FrontMiddleBack` class:
`FrontMiddleBack()` Initializes the queue.

`void pushFront(int val)` Adds `val` to the front of the queue.

`void pushMiddle(int val)` Adds `val` to the middle of the queue.

`void pushBack(int val)` Adds `val` to the back of the queue.

`int popFront()` Removes the front element of the queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.

`int popMiddle()` Removes the middle element of the queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.

`int popBack()` Removes the back element of the queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.

Notice that when there are two middle position choices, the operation is performed on the frontmost middle position choice. For example:
Pushing `6` into the middle of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` results in `[1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5]`.

Popping the middle from `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` returns `3` and results in `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`.

1673,Find the Most Competitive Subsequence,"Given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`, return the most competitive subsequence of `nums` of size `k`.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence `a` is more competitive than a subsequence `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, subsequence `a` has a number less than the corresponding number in `b`. For example, `[1,3,4]` is more competitive than `[1,3,5]` because the first position they differ is at the final number, and `4` is less than `5`.


Example 1:

1674,Minimum Moves to Make Array Complementary,"You are given an integer array `nums` of even length `n` and an integer `limit`. In one move, you can replace any integer from `nums` with another integer between `1` and `limit`, inclusive.

The array `nums` is complementary if for all indices `i` (0-indexed), `nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i]` equals the same number. For example, the array `[1,2,3,4]` is complementary because for all indices `i`, `nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] = 5`.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make `nums` complementary.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,4,3], limit = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: In 1 move, you can change nums to [1,2,2,3] (underlined elements are changed).

nums[0] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 = 4.

nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 2 = 4.

nums[2] + nums[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.

nums[3] + nums[0] = 3 + 1 = 4.

Therefore, nums[i] + nums[n-1-i] = 4 for every i, so nums is complementary.


Example 2:

Output: 2
Explanation: In 2 moves, you can change nums to [2,2,2,2]. You cannot change any number to 3 since 3 > limit.

For each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.

The ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.

The ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.

Return the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.


Example 1:
Input: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.

So the total number of trips is 4.

Note that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).


Example 2:
Input: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.


Example 3:
Input: boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.


Example 4:
Input: boxes = [[2,4],[2,5],[3,1],[3,2],[3,7],[3,1],[4,4],[1,3],[5,2]], portsCount = 5, maxBoxes = 5, maxWeight = 7
Output: 14
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the second box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the sixth and seventh boxes, goes to port 3, then port 4, then storage. 3 trips. 
- The ship takes the eighth and ninth boxes, goes to port 1, then port 5, then storage. 3 trips.

So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14.

1690,Stone Game VII,"Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can remove either the leftmost stone or the rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the sum of the remaining stones' values in the row. The winner is the one with the higher score when there are no stones left to remove.

Bob found that he will always lose this game (poor Bob, he always loses), so he decided to minimize the score's difference. Alice's goal is to maximize the difference in the score.

Given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` represents the value of the `ith` stone from the left, return the difference in Alice and Bob's score if they both play optimally.


Example 1:
Input: stones = [5,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- Alice removes 2 and gets 5 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 13 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 0, stones = [5,3,1,4].

- Bob removes 5 and gets 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 8, stones = [3,1,4].

- Alice removes 3 and gets 1 + 4 = 5 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 8, stones = [1,4].

- Bob removes 1 and gets 4 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = [4].

- Alice removes 4 and gets 0 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = [].

1691,Maximum Height by Stacking Cuboids,"Given `n` `cuboids` where the dimensions of the `ith` cuboid is `cuboids[i] = [widthi, lengthi, heighti]` (0-indexed). Choose a subset of `cuboids` and place them on each other.

You can place cuboid `i` on cuboid `j` if `widthi <= widthj` and `lengthi <= lengthj` and `heighti <= heightj`. You can rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it on another cuboid.

Return the maximum height of the stacked `cuboids`.


Example 1:
Input: cuboids = [[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]
Output: 190
Explanation:
Cuboid 1 is placed on the bottom with the 53x37 side facing down with height 95.

Cuboid 0 is placed next with the 45x20 side facing down with height 50.

Cuboid 2 is placed next with the 23x12 side facing down with height 45.

The total height is 95 + 50 + 45 = 190.


Example 2:
Input: cuboids = [[38,25,45],[76,35,3]]
Output: 76
Explanation:
You can't place any of the cuboids on the other.

We choose cuboid 1 and rotate it so that the 35x3 side is facing down and its height is 76.

1692,Count Ways to Distribute Candies,"There are `n` unique candies (labeled `1` through `n`) and `k` bags. You are asked to distribute all the candies into the bags such that every bag has at least one candy.

There can be multiple ways to distribute the candies. Two ways are considered different if the candies in one bag in the first way are not all in the same bag in the second way. The order of the bags and the order of the candies within each bag do not matter.

For example, `(1), (2,3)` and `(2), (1,3)` are considered different because candies `2` and `3` in the bag `(2,3)` in the first way are not in the same bag in the second way (they are split between the bags `(2)` and `(1,3)`). However, `(1), (2,3)` and `(3,2), (1)` are considered the same because the candies in each bag are all in the same bags in both ways.

Given two integers, `n` and `k`, return the number of different ways to distribute the candies. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 2

1754,Largest Merge Of Two Strings,"You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string `merge` in the following way: while either `word1` or `word2` are non-empty, choose one of the following options:
If `word1` is non-empty, append the first character in `word1` to `merge` and delete it from `word1`.

	
For example, if `word1 = ""abc"" `and `merge = ""dv""`, then after choosing this operation, `word1 = ""bc""` and `merge = ""dva""`.

If `word2` is non-empty, append the first character in `word2` to `merge` and delete it from `word2`.

	
For example, if `word2 = ""abc"" `and `merge = """"`, then after choosing this operation, `word2 = ""bc""` and `merge = ""a""`.

Return the lexicographically largest `merge` you can construct.

A string `a` is lexicographically larger than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in `b`. For example, `""abcd""` is lexicographically larger than `""abcc""` because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and `d` is greater than `c`.


Example 1:
Input: word1 = ""cabaa"", word2 = ""bcaaa""
Output: ""cbcabaaaaa""
Explanation: One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:
- Take from word1: merge = ""c"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""bcaaa""
- Take from word2: merge = ""cb"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""caaa""
- Take from word2: merge = ""cbc"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""aaa""
- Take from word1: merge = ""cbca"", word1 = ""baa"", word2 = ""aaa""
- Take from word1: merge = ""cbcab"", word1 = ""aa"", word2 = ""aaa""
- Append the remaining 5 a's from word1 and word2 at the end of merge.

1755,Closest Subsequence Sum,"You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is `sum`, then you want to minimize the absolute difference `abs(sum - goal)`.

Return the minimum possible value of `abs(sum - goal)`.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements (possibly all or none) of the original array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.

This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5
Output: 1
Explanation: Choose the subsequence [7,-9,-2], with a sum of -4.

The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.

You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:
Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.

	
For example, a bag of `5` balls can become two new bags of `1` and `4` balls, or two new bags of `2` and `3` balls.

Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2

- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].

- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].

The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].

- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].

Return `true` if you can do this task, and `false` otherwise.

Note that the subarrays are disjoint if and only if there is no index `k` such that `nums[k]` belongs to more than one subarray. A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.


Example 1:
Input: groups = [[1,-1,-1],[3,-2,0]], nums = [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0]

Explanation: You can choose the 0th subarray as [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0] and the 1st one as [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0].

These subarrays are disjoint as they share no common nums[k] element.


Example 2:

1776,Car Fleet II,"There are `n` cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array `cars` of length `n`, where `cars[i] = [positioni, speedi]` represents:
`positioni` is the distance between the `ith` car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that `positioni < positioni+1`.

`speedi` is the initial speed of the `ith` car in meters per second.

For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the slowest car in the fleet.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the time, in seconds, at which the `ith` car collides with the next car, or `-1` if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answers are accepted.

1778,Shortest Path in a Hidden Grid,"This is an interactive problem.

There is a robot in a hidden grid, and you are trying to get it from its starting cell to the target cell in this grid. The grid is of size `m x n`, and each cell in the grid is either empty or blocked. It is guaranteed that the starting cell and the target cell are different, and neither of them is blocked.

You want to find the minimum distance to the target cell. However, you do not know the grid's dimensions, the starting cell, nor the target cell. You are only allowed to ask queries to the `GridMaster` object.

Thr `GridMaster` class has the following functions:
`boolean canMove(char direction)` Returns `true` if the robot can move in that direction. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

`void move(char direction)` Moves the robot in that direction. If this move would move the robot to a blocked cell or off the grid, the move will be ignored, and the robot will remain in the same position.

`boolean isTarget()` Returns `true` if the robot is currently on the target cell. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Note that `direction` in the above functions should be a character from `{'U','D','L','R'}`, representing the directions up, down, left, and right, respectively.

Return the minimum distance between the robot's initial starting cell and the target cell. If there is no valid path between the cells, return `-1`.

Custom testing:
The test input is read as a 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n` where:
`grid[i][j] == -1` indicates that the robot is in cell `(i, j)` (the starting cell).

`grid[i][j] == 0` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is blocked.

`grid[i][j] == 1` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is empty.

`grid[i][j] == 2` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is the target cell.

There is exactly one `-1` and `2` in `grid`. Remember that you will not have this information in your code.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,2],[-1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible interaction is described below:
The robot is initially standing on cell (1, 0), denoted by the -1.

- master.canMove('U') returns true.

- master.canMove('D') returns false.

- master.canMove('L') returns false.

- master.canMove('R') returns false.

- master.move('U') moves the robot to the cell (0, 0).

- master.isTarget() returns false.

- master.canMove('U') returns false.

- master.canMove('D') returns true.

- master.canMove('L') returns false.

- master.canMove('R') returns true.

- master.move('R') moves the robot to the cell (0, 1).

- master.isTarget() returns true. 
We now know that the target is the cell (0, 1), and the shortest path to the target cell is 2.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,0,-1],[1,1,1],[2,0,0]]

authenticationManager.generate(""bbb"", 7); // Generates a new token with tokenId ""bbb"" at time 7.

authenticationManager.`renew`(""aaa"", 8); // The token with tokenId ""aaa"" expired at time 7, and 8 >= 7, so at time 8 the `renew` request is ignored, and nothing happens.

authenticationManager.`renew`(""bbb"", 10); // The token with tokenId ""bbb"" is unexpired at time 10, so the `renew` request is fulfilled and now the token will expire at time 15.

1801,Number of Orders in the Backlog,"You are given a 2D integer array `orders`, where each `orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei]` denotes that `amounti` orders have been placed of type `orderTypei` at the price `pricei`. The `orderTypei` is:
`0` if it is a batch of `buy` orders, or
`1` if it is a batch of `sell` orders.

Note that `orders[i]` represents a batch of `amounti` independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by `orders[i]` will be placed before all orders represented by `orders[i+1]` for all valid `i`.

There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:
If the order is a `buy` order, you look at the `sell` order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that `sell` order's price is smaller than or equal to the current `buy` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `sell` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `buy` order is added to the backlog.

Vice versa, if the order is a `sell` order, you look at the `buy` order with the largest price in the backlog. If that `buy` order's price is larger than or equal to the current `sell` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `buy` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `sell` order is added to the backlog.

Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.

- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.

- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.

- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.

Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.


Example 2:
Input: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]
Output: 999999984
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.

- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.

- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.

- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.

Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).

1807,Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String,"You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a non-empty key.

For example, in the string `""(name)is(age)yearsold""`, there are two bracket pairs that contain the keys `""name""` and `""age""`.

You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array `knowledge` where each `knowledge[i] = [keyi, valuei]` indicates that key `keyi` has a value of `valuei`.

You are tasked to evaluate all of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key `keyi`, you will:
Replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding `valuei`.

If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with a question mark `""?""` (without the quotation marks).

Each key will appear at most once in your `knowledge`. There will not be any nested brackets in `s`.

Return the resulting string after evaluating all of the bracket pairs.

Input: s = ""(name)is(age)yearsold"", knowledge = [[""name"",""bob""],[""age"",""two""]]
Output: ""bobistwoyearsold""
Explanation:
The key ""name"" has a value of ""bob"", so replace ""(name)"" with ""bob"".

The key ""age"" has a value of ""two"", so replace ""(age)"" with ""two"".


Example 2:
Input: s = ""hi(name)"", knowledge = [[""a"",""b""]]
Output: ""hi?""
Explanation: As you do not know the value of the key ""name"", replace ""(name)"" with ""?"".


Example 3:
Input: s = ""(a)(a)(a)aaa"", knowledge = [[""a"",""yes""]]
Output: ""yesyesyesaaa""
Explanation: The same key can appear multiple times.

The number of nice divisors of `n` is maximized. Note that a divisor of `n` is nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of `n`. For example, if `n = 12`, then its prime factors are `[2,2,3]`, then `6` and `12` are nice divisors, while `3` and `4` are not.

1810,Minimum Path Cost in a Hidden Grid,"This is an interactive problem.

There is a robot in a hidden grid, and you are trying to get it from its starting cell to the target cell in this grid. The grid is of size `m x n`, and each cell in the grid is either empty or blocked. It is guaranteed that the starting cell and the target cell are different, and neither of them is blocked.

Each cell has a cost that you need to pay each time you move to the cell. The starting cell's cost is not applied before the robot moves.

You want to find the minimum total cost to move the robot to the target cell. However, you do not know the grid's dimensions, the starting cell, nor the target cell. You are only allowed to ask queries to the `GridMaster` object.

The `GridMaster` class has the following functions:
`boolean canMove(char direction)` Returns `true` if the robot can move in that direction. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

`int move(char direction)` Moves the robot in that direction and returns the cost of moving to that cell. If this move would move the robot to a blocked cell or off the grid, the move will be ignored, the robot will remain in the same position, and the function will return `-1`.

`boolean isTarget()` Returns `true` if the robot is currently on the target cell. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Note that `direction` in the above functions should be a character from `{'U','D','L','R'}`, representing the directions up, down, left, and right, respectively.

Return the minimum total cost to get the robot from its initial starting cell to the target cell. If there is no valid path between the cells, return `-1`.

Custom testing:
The test input is read as a 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n` and four integers `r1`, `c1`, `r2`, and `c2` where:
`grid[i][j] == 0` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is blocked.

`grid[i][j] >= 1` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is empty and `grid[i][j]` is the cost to move to that cell.

`(r1, c1)` is the starting cell of the robot.

`(r2, c2)` is the target cell of the robot.

Remember that you will not have this information in your code.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[2,3],[1,1]], r1 = 0, c1 = 1, r2 = 1, c2 = 0
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible interaction is described below:
The robot is initially standing on cell (0, 1), denoted by the 3.

- master.canMove('U') returns false.

- master.canMove('D') returns true.

- master.canMove('L') returns true.

- master.canMove('R') returns false.

- master.move('L') moves the robot to the cell (0, 0) and returns 2.

- master.isTarget() returns false.

- master.canMove('U') returns false.

- master.canMove('D') returns true.

- master.canMove('L') returns false.

- master.canMove('R') returns true.

- master.move('D') moves the robot to the cell (1, 0) and returns 1.

- master.isTarget() returns true.

- master.move('L') doesn't move the robot and returns -1.

- master.move('R') moves the robot to the cell (1, 1) and returns 1.

We now know that the target is the cell (0, 1), and the minimum total cost to reach it is 2.

Input: grid = [[0,3,1],[3,4,2],[1,2,0]], r1 = 2, c1 = 0, r2 = 0, c2 = 2

1817,Finding the Users Active Minutes,"You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer `k`. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [IDi, timei]` indicates that the user with `IDi` performed an action at the minute `timei`.

Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.

The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a 1-indexed array `answer` of size `k` such that, for each `j` (`1 <= j <= k`), `answer[j]` is the number of users whose UAM equals `j`.

Return the array `answer` as described above.


Example 1:
Input: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5
Output: [0,2,0,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).

The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.

Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.


Example 2:
Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4
Output: [1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.

The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.

There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.

Hence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.


Constraints:
`1 <= logs.length <= 104`

1818,Minimum Absolute Sum Difference,"You are given two positive integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`.

The absolute sum difference of arrays `nums1` and `nums2` is defined as the sum of `|nums1[i] - nums2[i]|` for each `0 <= i < n` (0-indexed).

You can replace at most one element of `nums1` with any other element in `nums1` to minimize the absolute sum difference.

Return the minimum absolute sum difference after replacing at most one element in the array `nums1`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

`|x|` is defined as:
`x` if `x >= 0`, or
`-x` if `x < 0`.


Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,7,5], nums2 = [2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are two possible optimal solutions:
- Replace the second element with the first: [1,7,5] => [1,1,5], or
- Replace the second element with the third: [1,7,5] => [1,5,5].

Both will yield an absolute sum difference of `|1-2| + (|1-3| or |5-3|) + |5-5| = `3.


Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [2,4,6,8,10], nums2 = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: nums1 is equal to nums2 so no replacement is needed. This will result in an 
absolute sum difference of 0.


Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [1,10,4,4,2,7], nums2 = [9,3,5,1,7,4]
Output: 20
Explanation: Replace the first element with the second: [1,10,4,4,2,7] => [10,10,4,4,2,7].

This yields an absolute sum difference of `|10-9| + |10-3| + |4-5| + |4-1| + |2-7| + |7-4| = 20`

1819,Number of Different Subsequences GCDs,"You are given an array `nums` that consists of positive integers.

The GCD of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides all the numbers in the sequence evenly.

For example, the GCD of the sequence `[4,6,16]` is `2`.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10]`.

Return the number of different GCDs among all non-empty subsequences of `nums`.

1824,Minimum Sideway Jumps,"There is a 3 lane road of length `n` that consists of `n + 1` points labeled from `0` to `n`. A frog starts at point `0` in the second lane and wants to jump to point `n`. However, there could be obstacles along the way.

You are given an array `obstacles` of length `n + 1` where each `obstacles[i]` (ranging from 0 to 3) describes an obstacle on the lane `obstacles[i]` at point `i`. If `obstacles[i] == 0`, there are no obstacles at point `i`. There will be at most one obstacle in the 3 lanes at each point.

For example, if `obstacles[2] == 1`, then there is an obstacle on lane 1 at point 2.

The frog can only travel from point `i` to point `i + 1` on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point `i + 1`. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a side jump to jump to another lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the same point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.

For example, the frog can jump from lane 3 at point 3 to lane 1 at point 3.

Return the minimum number of side jumps the frog needs to reach any lane at point n starting from lane `2` at point 0.

Note: There will be no obstacles on points `0` and `n`.


Example 1:
Input: obstacles = [0,1,2,3,0]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The optimal solution is shown by the arrows above. There are 2 side jumps (red arrows).

Note that the frog can jump over obstacles only when making side jumps (as shown at point 2).

1825,Finding MK Average,"You are given two integers, `m` and `k`, and a stream of integers. You are tasked to implement a data structure that calculates the MKAverage for the stream.

The MKAverage can be calculated using these steps:
If the number of the elements in the stream is less than `m` you should consider the MKAverage to be `-1`. Otherwise, copy the last `m` elements of the stream to a separate container.

Remove the smallest `k` elements and the largest `k` elements from the container.

Calculate the average value for the rest of the elements rounded down to the nearest integer.

Implement the `MKAverage` class:
`MKAverage(int m, int k)` Initializes the MKAverage object with an empty stream and the two integers `m` and `k`.

`void addElement(int num)` Inserts a new element `num` into the stream.

`int calculateMKAverage()` Calculates and returns the MKAverage for the current stream rounded down to the nearest integer.
