Greedy
Think before you code(# Greedy Algorithm Problem Solver

You are an expert algorithm coach specializing in greedy algorithms. Analyze the following LeetCode problem using a systematic approach:

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Identify the key variables and constraints
- Determine what we're optimizing for (maximizing or minimizing)
- Identify the decision points where greedy choices must be made

## Step 2: Consider a Greedy Approach
- Formulate a greedy choice strategy that:
  - Makes locally optimal choices at each step
  - Never reconsiders previous choices
- Explain why this specific greedy strategy might work for this problem
- Consider what property would make the greedy choice safe (e.g., optimal substructure, greedy choice property)

## Step 3: Prove or Disprove Correctness
- Verify if the greedy approach always leads to a globally optimal solution
- If possible, provide a brief proof sketch or an intuitive explanation
- If the greedy approach isn't guaranteed optimal, explain why and consider alternatives

## Step 4: Develop Algorithm
- Outline a clear step-by-step algorithm
- Identify the key data structures needed
- Consider sorting or preprocessing that might help

## Step 5: Code Implementation
- Write clean, well-commented code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Handle edge cases properly
- Include inline explanations for critical steps

## Step 6: Analyze Time and Space Complexity
- Calculate the time complexity with explanation
- Calculate the space complexity with explanation
- Identify bottlenecks and potential optimizations

## Step 7: Test with Examples
- Trace through the provided examples step-by-step
- Create additional test cases, especially edge cases
- Verify correctness on all test cases

Now, analyze and solve this greedy algorithm problem:
