# Hash Table Problem Solving Prompt

## Task Overview
As an experienced software developer, your task is to design and implement a solution in Python 3 for the given problem using **Hash Tables (or Hash Maps)**. The following steps should be followed to ensure a comprehensive and correct solution:

### 1. **Analyze the Problem Requirements and Constraints**
   - Thoroughly review the problem's input, output, and constraints.
   - Identify any specific edge cases, such as minimal or extreme values, empty inputs, or other relevant corner cases.
   - Understand the problem's complexity requirements and ensure the solution operates efficiently (typically O(1) for lookups and insertions).

### 2. **Formulate a Clear Strategy for Hash Table Usage**
   - **Choosing the Right Data Structure**: 
     - Understand when to use a hash table. Hash tables are ideal when you need to perform frequent lookups, insertions, or deletions in constant time.
     - If the problem requires counting occurrences, storing key-value pairs, or quickly checking membership, a hash table is a good choice.
   
   - **Hash Function**: 
     - In Python, the built-in `dict` type provides an efficient implementation of a hash table. You typically don’t need to implement a custom hash function, as Python's `hash()` function is used under the hood.
   
   - **Collision Resolution**:
     - Most high-level implementations, like Python’s `dict`, handle collisions internally using techniques like chaining or open addressing. For custom implementations, consider how you would handle collisions (e.g., linear probing, quadratic probing, separate chaining).

   - **Insertion and Lookup**:
     - **Insertion**: Inserting an element into a hash table typically happens in O(1) time, assuming no collision occurs.
     - **Lookup**: Similarly, looking up an element in a hash table happens in O(1) time, assuming a good hash function and minimal collisions.

   - **Edge Case Handling**:
     - Ensure the algorithm handles all edge cases, such as:
       - Empty inputs (e.g., empty lists or strings)
       - Duplicates in the input
       - Handling of large datasets
       - Negative numbers or strings with special characters
       - Cases where no solution is possible

### 3. **Time Complexity Consideration**
   - **Time Complexity**: For a typical hash table:
     - **Insertions**: O(1) on average.
     - **Lookups**: O(1) on average.
     - **Deletions**: O(1) on average.
   
   - **Space Complexity**: Hash tables use O(n) space where `n` is the number of elements stored in the table.

   - **Worst-Case Scenario**: In the case of collisions (e.g., many items hashing to the same bucket), the time complexity can degrade to O(n), but this is rare with a good hash function and proper table resizing.

   - Provide an analysis of the algorithm’s time complexity and explain why it adheres to the optimal expected performance.

### 4. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Sample Case**: Start by testing your solution on the provided sample case to verify the correctness of your approach.
   
   - **Additional Test Cases**:
     - **Edge Cases**: Test with edge cases that could challenge the algorithm, such as:
       - **Empty Inputs**: An empty list or dictionary.
       - **Large Numbers**: Large values in the input.
       - **Duplicate Entries**: Handle duplicate values and ensure the algorithm works correctly.
       - **Multiple Keys with Same Hash Value**: Ensure collision resolution works as expected.

   - **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**: For at least one test case, provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the logic used to solve the problem. This can include intermediate values, hash table insertions, and lookups.

### 5. **Code Review and Refinement**
   - **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the algorithm handles edge cases like empty inputs, large values, and special characters correctly.
   
   - **Optimization**: After implementing the solution, review the code for potential optimization opportunities. For example:
     - Consider resizing the hash table dynamically to avoid excessive collisions.
     - Make sure to use the hash table efficiently, avoiding unnecessary recomputations.

   - **Validation**: Ensure all test cases pass, including edge cases. Confirm that the code handles all scenarios correctly and efficiently.
