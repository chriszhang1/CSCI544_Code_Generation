**This problem must be solved using a _queue_ (FIFO data structure). Please follow these steps:**

1. **Verify suitability**  
   Confirm that the algorithm’s logic requires first‑in‑first‑out processing—e.g., level‑order traversal, sliding‑window streaming, or multi‑source BFS—where elements are always handled in the order they were inserted.

2. **Choose an implementation**  
   - Use a standard container (`std::queue`, `std::deque`, or a ring buffer) for constant‑time `push`, `pop`, and `front`.  
   - If both ends are needed, switch to a double‑ended queue (`std::deque`).  
   - For concurrent scenarios, select a thread‑safe queue or implement locking.

3. **Define the queue element**  
   Specify what each entry stores: a single value, an index, or a composite struct (e.g., `{nodeID, depth}` in BFS).

4. **Describe core operations**  
   - **Enqueue:** add new elements at the back.  
   - **Dequeue:** remove and process the element at the front.  
   - **Peek / front:** read the front element without removal when necessary.

5. **Handle edge cases**  
   - Check for empty queue before calling `front`/`pop`.  
   - Prevent overflow if a bounded buffer is used.  
   - Manage large input streams by clearing or reusing memory when possible.

6. **Analyze complexity**  
   - Each `enqueue` and `dequeue` runs in `O(1)` amortized time.  
   - Total time is `O(N)` for `N` operations; space peaks at the maximum queue size during execution.

7. **Implement the full program**  
   Write clean, well‑commented code (e.g., C++ 17) that encapsulates queue logic in functions or a class, handles I/O efficiently, and avoids unnecessary copies.

8. **Test thoroughly**  
   - Run all provided samples.  
   - Add edge cases: empty queue operations, single‑element queue, stress test with the maximum possible number of enqueues.  
   - Verify that outputs match expectations and that no underflow or overflow occurs.  
   If any test fails, refine your algorithm and code until every requirement is satisfied.
